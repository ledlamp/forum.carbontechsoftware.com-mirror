It would show there is a mine in the area, but you don&#039;t know exactly where it is unless you look very closely. And that takes time.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>On this one i dare to disagree...I think, as answered also on some other discussion about mines, it is not a good idea to cloack mines. It woudl make them OP. Forcing your enemies to avoid mines without cloackign them takes time just as well, and gives you a tactical advantage + if they get it wrong they go &quot;boom&quot;. This said, if the majority of the community would want this, i&#039;m sure CT woudl take it into consideration-what expressed here is only my own opinion, and in a different way, with some further tweaking(on number of uses and effect, nto to make them OP) cloacking them could work too.<br /><br /><br />One thing that i woudl love tho,(<span style="font-size: 0.7em;" class="bbc_size">IF this system were to be integrated, and henceforth mines becoming finally an integrating part of CC life</span>) woudl be for mines to show as tiny dots(1 px?) on the minimap.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="../../feedback-ideas/new-mine-items/msg213/index.html#msg213">Quote from: FatCatAttack on <span title=" 15, 2012, 12:12:20 am" style="cursor:default">Mid-July, 2012</span></a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I like drop bombs as they are not &quot;passive&quot; mines like the rest of them, but they need to be tweeked if they don&#039;t obtain Drop bombs could use a guiding program, always falling to the ground but slowly following the closest target. Otherwise with the speed of cars and the fact that you need to get above the target (most players spend their days more in the air than the ground, as stated before) this would be a waste.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>i understand where you are coming from. I personally don&#039;t think drop bombs should have any &quot;homing&quot; system. OR -if they would- they woudl need to be toned down in the other specs(number of uses and damage/effect).<br />Giving them a homing system for which you dont&#039; even have to sweat for aiming correctly(like with missiles) woudl make them really OP.<br />Moreover, if the &quot;right doubleclick to detonate&quot; system were to be implemented, there would be tons of creative ways to use them even for defensive manouvres..(mounting the C3 ones and using them to be kicked away from danger by detonating them straight away)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="../../feedback-ideas/new-mine-items/msg213/index.html#msg213">Quote from: FatCatAttack on <span title=" 15, 2012, 12:12:20 am" style="cursor:default">Mid-July, 2012</span></a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Floating mines, I think it would fit better if they were a minefield. 5 mini-mines eject out the back of your car with one use would allow them to spread over a larger area than just one big mine. The reason behind this is actually psychological; you would avoid at all costs a big floating ball that explodes, but a minefield is dangerous but possibly able to navigate if you need to. So, if you deploy a big mine behind you during an air chase the enemy&#039;s priority no. 1 would be to avoid that mine, but if it was a cloud of mines there is less intimidation and your pursuer might actually try to weave between the mini-mines. It wouldn&#039;t usually work, but it is possible, and that can be enough.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>LOVE this suggestion. <br />Id&#039; say , let&#039;s make it <strong>6 </strong>mini mines, so their damage can be aligned with the ground mines (according to my suggestion, anti-tank-barlooking like, but with <strong>6 </strong>charges) so we spare CT some damage calcualtions <img src="../../Smileys/akyhne/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" /> <br />

					&nbsp;<span class="bbc_u">This&nbsp; is the proposition of a “mine system”, informed by the experience with the current one and inspired&nbsp; by the comments and ideas of most of the active members,</span>including cremy’s&nbsp; idea above, FCA’s comments and yesterday’s discussion with cremy and gex.<br />&nbsp;<strong><br /><span class="bbc_u">Let me get out of the way one&nbsp; practicality:</span></strong><br />Part of this system is based on the idea, that it would be possible to have a command to detonate mines. Specifically: the mine that amongst the ones you have deployed, is closest to your vehicle. Ideally, a right double-click, else a letter key(Z?X?C? do they already have a function?).<br /><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color"><strong>@CT</strong></span>: I’m hoping this IS actually possible, or something similar is. What WOULD be possible?<br />&nbsp;<br />From the ideas cremy porposed(C3,C4,C5) originally, i’ve kept the C3 family; <span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color"><strong>the C4 family’s function(being able to detonate the mines you placed) w<span class="bbc_u">ould be applied to the whole mine park, making them a more viable option vs temp invicibility</span></strong></span>. The C5 (freezing/liquid nitrogen mines) would be a viable addition in the future as an extra FAMILY(read on to know what I mean).<br /><br />I’ve taken the liberty of disregarding the current mines organization, so that, instead of describing “<em>how to change</em>” it, I could describe few practical implications of“<em>how would it look like at the end, when/if implemented</em>”.<br />One more thing, before cutting to the bone: even tho it’s not included in the system, I’d still like to see the spiky stripes proposed by speeddemon integrated, as they have a very clear use.<br />&nbsp;<br /><span class="bbc_u">The system’s logic is based on cross-referencing :</span><br />- <span style="text-shadow: red 1px 1px 1px">4 GENRES</span> of mines&nbsp; based on their “use” <br />with <br />-<span style="text-shadow: red 1px 1px 1px">5 FAMILIES</span> of mines&nbsp; based on their “filling”<br />&nbsp;<br /><span class="bbc_u"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">GENRES</span></span><br />a)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="text-shadow: yellow -2px 0 1px"><span class="bbc_u"><strong>Ground mines</strong></span></span>- these would behave as the ones we’ve had in-shop until today. You deploy them- they stick to the floor. The biggest drawback experienced so far, is that the current mines are really easy to avoid, EVEN if you are on the floor, so all the floor mines would have the shape of the current anti-tank-bar mine; their lower practical range of use, respective to both the temp invicibility and other kinds of mines, would be offset by adding 2 more charges to the current 4, making the mine stripes as wide as a car<span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="bbc_size">(maybe deploying from behind the rear wheels?)</span>and having 16 uses/life(10 at present time feels extremely limited).<br />b)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="text-shadow: yellow -2px 0 1px"><span class="bbc_u"><strong>Bouncing Betty mines</strong></span></span>- these are still ground mines,but with a different use. When deployed, they would look&nbsp; like a small lid on the floor(like the current mines look when deployed). When triggered, these mines launch into the air and then detonate at about the height of 3 meters,b becoming dangerous not only for whom triggered them, but also for&nbsp; those in the surroundings.<br />Their lower chance of being triggered should be offset by a very high effect per single trigger, and for a total of 16 uses/life. <br />c)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="text-shadow: yellow -2px 0 1px"><span class="bbc_u"><strong>Drop bombs</strong></span></span>- dropped from any altitude; their drop pattern&nbsp; would be equal to adding G vertical downwards acceleration to the speed and direction in which the car was travelling at the precise moment of deployment.&nbsp; Their scarce precision(you cant’ see underneat your car)&nbsp; is offset by an unlimited number of uses, deploying 1/sec and more limited effect.<br />d)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="text-shadow: yellow -2px 0 1px"><span class="bbc_u"><strong>Floating/contact mines</strong></span></span>Floating/contact mines- imagine a canister with 3 tiny propellers on top, keeping it floating in the air. (CC style all the way !)The dimension of the CC canister would fit the bill perfectly, these would be by far the most useable, so their number of uses max&nbsp; 8/life.<br /><span class="bbc_u"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">FAMILIES</span></span><br />1)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="text-shadow: yellow -2px 0 1px"><span class="bbc_u"><strong>NUCLEAR FAMILY</strong></span></span>(liberator like): When triggered of detonated by user, they cause high concentrated explosion damage on a reduced radius.<br />2)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="text-shadow: yellow -2px 0 1px"><span class="bbc_u"><strong>NITROGLYCERIN FAMILY</strong></span></span>(proximity mine like): Very easily triggered, as it is a very unstable chemical substance (as opposed to the TNT used to detonate nuclear bombs), further made more dangerous by a system of proximity sensors. It deals about half the damage then the relative nuclear version, it covers about half the radius then the relative C3 concussion version. The extremely high speed at which it incendiates the area, creates about no impact wave.<br />3)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="text-shadow: yellow -2px 0 1px"><span class="bbc_u"><strong>The C3 CONCUSSION FAMILY</strong></span></span>: when triggered or detonated by user, they cause a very wide spherical impact wave, pushing everything away, with almost 0 explosion damage. The radius of effect depends on the family of the mine, roughly ranges between 5 meters and 40 meters(that means a sphere bigger than a red or blue base), with a gradient making the effect extremely violent if close to the blast focus, decreasing exponentially into being only a slight destabilization if at the border of the effect radius.<br />4)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="text-shadow: yellow -2px 0 1px"><span class="bbc_u"><strong>LOCALISED EMP FAMILY</strong></span></span>: we all know what that means already; stunning the enemy <span style="font-family: Wingdings;" class="bbc_font">J</span><br />5)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="text-shadow: yellow -2px 0 1px"><span class="bbc_u"><strong>WIDER RANGE EMP FAMILY</strong></span></span>: covering about half the radius of the relative concussion family, stunning for about half the time of the relative localized family. The mine works in 2 stages,first a can of compressed highly conductive liquid(a mix of gold parcticles and chemically clean water) explodes, “spraying” everything in it’s radius. Right afterwards, the emp pulse is discharged, stunning everyone that was “sprayed” , even if it moved.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong> <span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color">Please find a readable version of the system attached at the end of this post</span></strong><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="bbc_size">Let me say, I have literally just put together this, so I haven’t concentrated too much on the details. Some combinations between family/genre might be OP, and might need a rethink. Some combinations have already some consideratios about leveling the mines, others are missing.. Happy to hear opinions about it, in case the community will like this, all can be further defined.</span><br /><br />&nbsp;To the game-play, this would be a big revolution, and in my opinion an improvement. It would bring some mines(that would need to be made more expensive) up to a similar usability level of the invincibility, which would still keep the edge only for being fail-safe, while mines can still be avoided by others..<br />&nbsp;Also, for CT this means more items to sell, higher chance of people buying credits <span style="font-family: Wingdings;" class="bbc_font">J</span><br />&nbsp;<br />I would also like to stress that any of the “FAMILIES” could be widened in time and applied to the grenade launcher, and also the command to detonate the mines could be applied to grenades the same way..<br />&nbsp;<br />FEW EXAMPLES of how the mines would become more of an integrant part of CC:<br /><span style="font-family: Symbol;" class="bbc_font">· </span>In DM or TDM: I have equipped missile launcher and railgun, while I have a guy with shotgun right behind my tail up-close. Too close. I can’t re estabilish a good distance for my weapons, as he has the sprinter bodykit. I deploy a floating mine and detonate it straight away either damaging him badly or re estabilishing the distance or stunning him to counterattack.<br /><span style="font-family: Symbol;" class="bbc_font">· </span>Ground mines are, simple to understand. Mostly useful for DM and TDM, same as the bouncing betties, thnks to their improved usability(more damage, more charges, more uses) one could think about placing them not only close to flags, but also close to health or invisibility pickups, with a certified harvesting result.<br /><span style="font-family: Symbol;" class="bbc_font">· </span>Drop bombs, would be the most difficult to use effectively, but fun!&nbsp; Maybe somebody would have the patience to learn to drop them in the chimneys of the blue and red bases above their own flag.<br /><span style="font-family: Symbol;" class="bbc_font">· </span>There is one place where&nbsp; no car can hit, and that is underneath it, so if anyone is attackgin you from underneath- THERE ! DROP BOMB!<br /><span style="font-family: Symbol;" class="bbc_font">· </span>C3’s shockwave could become extremely fun and extremely useful in ctf or in any dogfight situation.

In the last 200 meters ther should be 2 more walls added in between the bigger ones, at 20 meters distance, with targets(so he needs to fly in between a narrower space while aiming at closer targets). The player&#039;s task is to glide towards the target platfrom on the floor and while doing so, activating scope(shift) when needed to shot the targets on the walls, adding CTRL when needed to brake in order to shoot more targets when they are closer together. The player shoudl be reminded with an onscreen keyboard how to glide and and brake while gliding. on the ending platform there is an invisibility powerup- getting that one too, will result in a +30% bonus on the score of the test.</li></ul></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The training, being quite comprehensive, would need to have an opt-out before each new practical task, but that part is up to CT.

Truthfully though, I think they might as well be scrapped. The mini-bar mine isn&#039;t worth it&#039;s cost and it is one of the cheapest items in the game, the liberator is only useful when you have a guarantee enemies will travel along a section, and the rest of the mines are a mixed bag that are not only underpowered but also virtually all similar, with unbalanced costs. We need to differentiate the current mines, fix the costs, and make them more powerful in order for them to be a viable option compared to say the temp invincibility item (2:30 seconds of invincibility each round at lvl 20). If we were to use some of these ideas to spice up current mines, it could work.<br /><br />Remember that the isn&#039;t a lot displayed on the shop as well, so if you were to add new mines we would need to make their function simple enough to be explained in one sentence.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>100% agreed.<br />i was afraid of saying it out loud, just cuase it seems i always say the same things...<br />FCA- from 2.8 CT changed invincibility, now it&#039;s once per life, as suggested on the old forum. it opened up the game a lot <img src="../../Smileys/akyhne/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />
