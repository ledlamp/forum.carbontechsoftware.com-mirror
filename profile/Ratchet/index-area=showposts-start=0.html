Does only 2 HP of Damage per bullet against unarmored cars. 1 HP against armored.<br /><br /><br />#6: Again, not a bad idea, but the soldier needs to have the same restrictions as any other game - Limited ammo and ammo accessibility. <br />The SMG that the Soldier currently has, has about the same ROF of the minigun and unlimited ammo. Decrease the damage it outputs, limit the SMG ammo to 20 round mags with 80-100 in reserve ammo, and increase the damage model of car weapons vs a Soldier.

					I also just learned this recently, but Drifting and sliding with style are different things.<br />Sliding usually just means letting go of the accelerator and turning at high speeds, but Drifting usually requires the Hand-Brake Technique or a car that is a stick-shift for the Clutch-Kick Technique &gt;.&gt;<br />I&#039;m not saying your idea is bad, actually I like it, its just drifting and sliding are different.

The reason I say this, is two months ago, I sent an email to CarbonTech, asking for the Source Code of Carbon Combat to be transferred into my possession, so that I could continue development on Carbon Combat with the aid of TheCyberMan. I did not inform you all of this previously, due to the fact that I knew everyone would have different opinions, and I thought it best to tell you about my actions once I had successfully obtained the source code.<br /><br /><br />CarbonTech never replied.<br /><br /><br />Here I will post a copy of the email that I sent to CarbonTech, so that you all may read it and understand my motives and actions better. However, his lack of response is very puzzling- it is so unlike CarbonTech to not respond to emails like this...<br /><br /><br />Here is a copy of the email (images are not included):<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Reply With Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CarbonTech,<br />&nbsp;<br />You may or may not be aware of what is happening currently with Carbon Combat. I am writing this letter to inform you thusly, and make a request of you that could make the Carbon Combat game and forum better places. First of all, I would like to examine the state that Carbon Combat is currently in, and where the source of this problem lies.<br />&nbsp;<br />Like Mars used to be, Carbon Combat is in a bit of a “depression” at the moment. There are hackers in the game. There are spammers on the forum. There are people who overall try to make Carbon Combat worse for others. And many people in the Carbon Combat community do not believe that this should happen. They believe that these hackers should be banned, these spammers should be brought to justice, and the people who make Carbon Combat worse should put their efforts into making it a better game – not a worse one. There are constant flame wars on the forum, and in almost every scenario, no matter what is said, someone always tries to attack it. Let’s take a look at this post, called “Epic New Car”. It was put up relatively recently, and exploded into an intense flame war between many different people.<br />&nbsp;<br />It started off with Transformers60 posting a post about a new car idea. It received a few mildly insulting comments here and there, but nothing too major.<br />&nbsp;<br />This is his post:<br /><img src="http://forum.carbontechsoftware.com/file://localhost/Users/michaelcooper/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/msoclip/0/clip_image002.png" alt="Description: Macintosh HD:Users:michaelcooper:Desktop:Screen shot 2013-06-20 at 1.48.44 PM.png" width="434" height="155" border="0" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);" class="bbc_img" /><br />&nbsp;<br />Here is one of the comments shortly after:<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><img src="http://forum.carbontechsoftware.com/file://localhost/Users/michaelcooper/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/msoclip/0/clip_image004.png" alt="Description: Macintosh HD:Users:michaelcooper:Desktop:Screen shot 2013-06-20 at 1.49.12 PM.png" width="434" height="125" border="0" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);" class="bbc_img" /><br />&nbsp;<br />Others posted more comments, eventually getting more and more insulting. TheCyberMan tried to calm things down by posting a kind comment toward Transformers60:<br />&nbsp;<img src="http://forum.carbontechsoftware.com/file://localhost/Users/michaelcooper/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/msoclip/0/clip_image006.png" alt="Description: Macintosh HD:Users:michaelcooper:Desktop:Screen shot 2013-06-20 at 1.49.23 PM.png" width="434" height="153" border="0" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);" class="bbc_img" /><br />&nbsp;<br />This made many others who had previously commented mad, and it essentially exploded into an all out flame war very quickly. People began insulting each other quite directly, and eventually, the topic had to be locked in order to prevent further flaming.<br />&nbsp;<br />This is not the kind of situation that we want to see on the Carbon Combat forum. We are a community, and should be supportive of each other- we should build each other up, not tear each other down. The worst part about this is that in recent months, flame wars like the one described above are becoming more and more common. Small insults are normal on the forum now, and it is rare to see the majority of feedback be positive. Mostly, people are gradually insulting each other more on this forum. This is not the kind of situation that I want to see, that the Mods want to see, or (undoubtedly) you want to see on this forum. This needs to change.<br />&nbsp;<br />I was talking with TheCyberMan about his thoughts on the situation on Carbon Combat, and he (and I) both believe that the root of the problem is stagnant development. The game has not received an update in months, you have not logged into your account on the forum for a month, and people are getting bored of the lack of development. When people join a game, they are excited to see new features coming out, and new developments being added to the game. Therefore, if a game suddenly stops being developed, it will eventually bore the participants, and they will try to amuse themselves in other ways. Currently, Carbon Combat is lacking constant developments, so people are trying to amuse themselves in other ways. This is why people are hacking the game, this is why people are spamming the forums, this is why people are constantly fighting with each other: they are bored, and want to amuse themselves in other ways. Carbon Combat no longer presents a suitable source of amusement for these players, and this is due to the lack of continuing development on the game.<br />&nbsp;<br />This lack of development not only is creating hacking, spamming, and flame wars, it also hinders the number of players that are on the game at any one time. Recently, both TheCyberMan and I have almost never seen more than 30 concurrent players on the game at any one time (most of which are probably computer-controlled cars). This means that battles are not as intense (seeing as there are not as many participating players), and gameplay is nowhere near as stimulating as it could be, with more players on Carbon Combat. <br />&nbsp;<br />As I am sure you already know, Aubrey Falconer released the Mars Explorer source code under an open-source license on August 22, 2012. Aubrey made this decision for one main reason: Aubrey recognized that he could no longer continue development on Mars Explorer, and passed it into the hands of others to continue developing. As you are most likely aware of, Flyclub took up the torch of development on Mars, but passed it on to TheCyberMan when he could no longer continue development (for personal reasons). When Aubrey could no longer develop Mars Explorer, he gave it to others to continue developing. This kept people interested, and got Mars Explorer out of the rut that it had been in. CarbonTech, in the “Bio” section for your (Achilles)+ ATI profile, I quote:<br />&nbsp;<br />“This is my final message, my last goodbye to all those still stuck in the rut of Mars.”<div style="text-align: right;">-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Achilles, 2011</div> <br />Because of Aubrey releasing the game open-source, because of Aubrey allowing others to continue development, and because the Mars Explorer’s development is no longer stagnant, Mars Explorer is now out of that rut. People are supportive, creative, and aiding in Mars’ development. Development was allowed to continue, positive action followed. It could be the same for Carbon Combat.<br />&nbsp;<br />TheCyberMan and I were discussing the possibility of allowing Carbon Combat to continue development. Because TheCyberMan is still working on Mars, he agreed to be a co-developer, and I would become the primary developer for Carbon Combat. While I currently know rudimentary JavaScript, TheCyberMan stated that he would be willing to help with the coding while I got my JavaScript skills on par with what is needed to develop this game to its potential.<br />&nbsp;<br />I was discussing this option with another forum member, U2M, and he was supportive of the idea the Carbon Combat would continue development. He believes that stagnant development is the source of many of the problems in Carbon Combat, and on the Carbon Combat forum. He believes that, should Carbon Combat continue development, it would create a stronger community, as well as making Carbon Combat (both the game and forum) better for everyone. I quote from a private message that he sent me:<br />&nbsp;<br />“I believe in our community being strengthened and progress and not degraded down to nothing but self-centered comments and thoughts. I believe that we can make CC a better place for everyone. Carbon Combat and its community are practically family. I don&#039;t want my family in pain and anger, but instead in happiness and progression.”<div style="text-align: right;">-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;U2M</div> <br />We are not asking that you release the game completely open-source. We are not asking that you allow anyone to get their hands on the game you have worked on for two years. What we are asking is allowing two of your most trusted, capable moderators to ensure that this game has a future, and that Carbon Combat will dig itself out of the rut that it is currently in. TheCyberMan and I would be willing to continue development on the game to ensure that the community is no longer bored with this stagnant development of Carbon Combat, but are excited about continued development, and excited about new features that these new developments will have to offer.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you choose to accept this offer, I imagine that we will be in correspondence about the specifics of licensing and royalties, as well as a few other details that will need sorting out. If you accept this offer, TheCyberMan has kindly offered to pay for the Carbon Combat servers. This will, of course, mean that the forum and game will be moved to a new home at <a href="http://www.cybuniv.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.cybuniv.com</a>, similar to what is happening with Terrium (the new developing version of Mars Explorer) now. All finances and management of the game (if desired) will be transferred to TheCyberMan and me – if you wish, you will not have to manage the game/forum, or continue making payments to pay for the Carbon Combat server. <br />&nbsp;<br />If this offer is accepted, TheCyberMan and I will do our best to ensure that Carbon Combat has a bright and positive future.<br />&nbsp;<br />CarbonTech, thank you for reading this and considering this offer. I thank you for your time, and I look forward to your response.<br />&nbsp;<br />Kind regards,<br />Apophis<br />&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />There you have it- my attempt to obtain Carbon Combat&#039;s source code so that the game can continue to develop further. If he has left us, I am slightly puzzled by who pays for the servers, although it is a possibility that CarbonTech is using his Dropbox account to host Carbon Combat (yes, it is possible to use Dropbox as file hosting).<br /><br /><br />Anyways, that is all. I hope you understand what I did, and why I did it. Please contact me with any further questions/comments. Though you may not see me, I log in regularly. <img src="../../Smileys/akyhne/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /> <br /><br /><br />-Apophis<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />You might want to edit that so the blank photos don&#039;t appear &gt;.&gt;

					The way it works on Mars is if someone joins the game, they are taken to a password entering screen.<br />However, they can be invited directly into the game by the host.<br /><br /><br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54510242/PasswordProtectedGame.png" alt="" border="0" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);" class="bbc_img" />

					(Sorry for the bump... x.x)<br />But what is the newest Carbon Combat version with a standalone? I searched through the old posts (I went down to 2.3) and I can&#039;t find any links. And when I run the one I have auto-update pops up but the link is broken... ._.<br />Please help so I can play this game again.

					So we all know that what we can do as the Soldier is limited (for now...) and some of us would like to have more options. So I&#039;ve made a list of Animations (or Actions) that the Soldier should be able to do:<br />#1: Vaulting: In the discipline of parkour, a vault is any type of movement that involves jumping or leaping over an obstacle while putting weight on it with one&#039;s hands. Parkour vaults enable the practitioner (traceur) to quickly and efficiently pass over railings, tables, walls, and platforms.<br /><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Parkour_-_Poliana.jpg/200px-Parkour_-_Poliana.jpg" alt="" border="0" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);" class="bbc_img" /><img src="http://cache4.asset-cache.net/xc/3165793.jpg?v=1&c=IWSAsset&k=2&d=45B0EB3381F7834D5AC2B80DB6767DD176461E471C2D5B5905AFC5CF6109BBC7" alt="" border="0" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);" class="bbc_img" /><br />I&#039;m some many of you have done this in real life for various reasons (At least I did... &gt;_&lt;), and know how it works. You vault over (or on top of) an object in your way.<br />#2 Crawling: The leopard crawl is a military-specific crawl. There are two versions, the leopard crawl proper and a modified version for when carrying weapons in the hands. This is a two-beat gait like a trot: an arm/elbow is advanced with the diagonal knee. This is designed for the smallest silhouette possible, and the body is often nearly or actually touching the ground, and although the elbow and knee are the main focus, most of the respective limbs touch the ground.<br /><img src="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSkSw8IG8CqSiE_dGBhsvoG9I7xgZvnvDplSjdtPNLdyZ58xzWTSA" alt="" border="0" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);" class="bbc_img" /><br />#3 Cover: A cover system is video game gameplay mechanic that allows a virtual avatar to avoid dangers, usually in a three-dimensional (and occasionally two-dimensional) world. This method is a digital adaptation of the real-life military tactic of taking cover to dodge enemy gunfire or explosives.<br /><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/91/MetalGearSolid2-Substance_screenshot1.jpg/220px-MetalGearSolid2-Substance_screenshot1.jpg" alt="" border="0" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);" class="bbc_img" /><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5e/Kill.Switch_Cover_System_Gameplay.jpg/220px-Kill.Switch_Cover_System_Gameplay.jpg" alt="" border="0" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);" class="bbc_img" /><br />#4 Melee Combat: &quot;Melee&quot; has been adopted and popularized as a term in war-gaming, board games, tabletop role-playing games and video games to encompass all close-quarter fighting and directly striking an opponent at ranges generally less than a few feet with, but not only, fists, feet, knives, rifle-butts or any other melee weapon or special spells or tactics with the intention of causing harm.<br /><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRXUcJdr6Iqql1hnh76JAUzRrzsEaA4J_kTJ0YgpRAtYWdiRYWPrA" alt="" border="0" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);" class="bbc_img" /><br />(But with a gun... Ya&#039;ll know what I mean...)<br />#5 Roll: An evasive action or evasive maneuver is an exercise aimed at avoiding an object, attack, or opponent.<br /><img src="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTRgNFSyuXLUozkq_MuJuptiHvAeMigwYxXD4iHOHocNuB3xc_YAQ" alt="" border="0" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);" class="bbc_img" /><br />#6 Ledge Traversal: The Ledge Traversal was a move could be perform be preformed in some game like Ratchet &amp; Clank and Splinter Cell. First they had to jump on to a ledge, doing a Ledge Grab, then move to the left or right, traversing the ledge. The Ledge Traversal along with the Ledge Grab was useful for navigating through difficult platforms, and small areas. To do a Ledge Traversal you had to navigate to the left or right by using the Left Analog stick.<br /><img src="http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120421151949/ratchet/images/thumb/0/02/Ratchet_grabbing_on_a_ledge.JPG/320px-Ratchet_grabbing_on_a_ledge.JPG" alt="" border="0" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);" class="bbc_img" /> <br />Thanks for reading, comments, suggestions and constructive critisim is welcomed. <br />
