					Many of us know that our flying cars are pretty awesome. We defy gravity in our own little way. <br />&nbsp;<br />But has anyone ever stopped to ask, &quot;How exactly do we get off the ground?&quot; Well, we Just fold out our wheels and take off; simple as that.<br />&nbsp;<br />However, I stopped and thought to myself, &quot;Doesn&#039;t someone know how much friction is put under four wheels why traveling 90 mph? A lot. When the wheels fold out, from the ground, they look like this:<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HHeFPUv.jpg" alt="" border="0" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);" class="bbc_img" /><br />Now, if I am correct, 90 mph is 130 ft per second. That speed is enough to travel a football field in 2 seconds. Apply a direct amount of friction to that speed and you have a little problem. <br />&nbsp;<br />Now, our game graphics are just fine, as many know. I just wish to make a the game&#039;s physics look better. Though it is not needed, it will improve game graphics. I am all for improved game graphics in Carbon Combat.<br />&nbsp;<br />Any thoughts on how we can make this &quot;rubbing of wheels on the ground&quot; look go away?

					<br /><br />Hello Carbon Combat Community!<br /><br />As you allay know, Carbon Combat has some pretty amazing maps. From the crashed ship on Battle Island to the open hatches on Silos. Each map is unique and has a certain feel to them. <br /><br />But I want to bring in a new &quot;feel&quot; for a new map. And at first it may seem a little hard and/or &quot;unlinked,&quot; but please let me explain.<br /><br />The new map idea is a city. Not just any city, but a city made specifically for Carbon Combat. <br /><br />Now you may be saying something like, &quot;That is just not fitting the CC Theme we have.&quot;<br /><br />Now I say this:<br />Carbon Combat needs a new feeling. A feeling of modern society; much like the cities and freeways we have today. of us, including myself, do not live in cities with majorly high skyscrapers and huge 40 story tall business buildings. Some of us live in the suburbs. So I incorporate my idea with people&#039;s surroundings to create a map that is both rich in smaller houses and bigger industrial buildings. <br /><br />Please comment on what you think. Even I am a bit &quot;iffy&quot; about the idea, but please let me know first what you believe.

					Hello Carbon Combat Community! <br /><br />Before I get to my point, I just want to point out how much time I put into thinking about all of the ideas below. Please comment with your honest opinion, and say why if you like. <br /><br />　<br />*I use the example of the rocket launcher for most of the ideas as this weapon is a base weapon of the game.*<br /><br />　<br />ENJOY!!! <br /><br />Game Design Idea #1:<em><strong><span class="bbc_u"> Reload Animation</span></strong></em> <br />The idea is simple. When a person is reloading their weapon, some guns will show that they are being reloaded. (e.g. <span class="bbc_u">Railgun</span>: Small cartridge pops out; simple as that.) Though not all guns will be able to show some sort of Reload Animation (Flamethrower), it can be done. It can also help a player to determine what the other player is doing. Reload-wise; maybe plan out how to come at the enemy. Some weapons (Mini and Shotgun) won&#039;t need animation; they currently have an animation for ammo/reload. The other List of Reload Animation is shown below:&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="bbc_u">Laser Cannon</span>: After being fired, a small amount of smoke (a smaller version of the smoke shown with a person’s low health) will spill from the front of the barrel of the cannon. As it cools down, the Laser&#039;s red color will become as it normally is or before it is fired. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="bbc_u">Railgun</span>: After firing the high caliber round, the gun will cool down and a magazine/cartridge will pop out. I see the gun firing a green round instead of a blue one in my mind. The animation would possibly look better if the main color was green. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="bbc_u">Plasma Blaster</span>: After the rounds of Plasma have gone, the gun will appear to &quot;cool down&quot; much like the Laser, but faster and with a lower amount of red light shown.&nbsp; Even though there may be more, I just wanted to give a little idea of what the animation would do or look like for some if all possible weapons. I didn’t say it above, but it is possible for the Laser Cannon to have a cartridge that pops out of the cannon as well; just a little bigger and red instead of blue. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Game Design Idea #2: <em><span class="bbc_u"><strong>Area Effects</strong></span></em> <br />In this idea, different objects and parts of the environment are affected by weapons and other items. From Burn marks, to pieces of the ground falling apart, the idea would make this game that much better. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="bbc_u">Explosives</span>: Every time you fire a rocket at a target, you either miss or hit it. Either way, when it hits a target or object, there is an explosion. But what happens when you look back at what your warhead hit? You see it just as it was before. When and explosive weapon, item, or object explodes, there should be a mark showing what &quot;occurred.&quot; For instance, Lets say you shoot the ground. When the smoke clears and you can see the ground, you will see a black mark, much like what you see with most explosives. <br /><br />*To add to explosives category, a new weapon. This weapon is called the Cluster Shot, or something similar to that. What it does is simple and is in the name; the explosives cluster up into one attack. Let’s say you use the Rocket Launcher. When the rocket explodes, there will be five smaller explosives thrown out about 3 feet adding an area damage or extra damage to a missed target. The strength of the Cluster is that of a missile launcher and the smaller explosives are either half or ¼ of the missile launcher’s damage. Please comment on the idea.* <br /><br />·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="bbc_u">Fire</span>: As wee all know, there is a Flame thrower in Carbon Combat. This weapon set fire to its target (CC Combat Car). But nobody put into consideration how cool it would be to set fire to trees and other smaller parts of the ground, such as the grass on Battle Island. Now, you may be saying &quot;That will create a major amount of lag…&quot; You see, this statement is not technically true. You see other cars flying and moving around while they are fire. Setting fire to an object that is immobile will not really create a difference lag-wise. Setting fire to the ground would be harder to do than set a tree on fire, just so that you can control the lag that may develop. This game creates its own lag most of the time, it isn’t uncommon.&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="bbc_u">Water</span>: Currently, no matter how you hit the water, you see a splash. Though, this splash is not very grand; even when a car flying into it at 110 miles per hour. The idea of water is to simply make splashes bigger and splash out at the angle an object entered the water. The biggest splash wouldn’t need to be any bigger than the circumference of the car itself. The same to other weapons. The laser would have no effect, while a rocket would hit the water normally and progressively splash out as the explosion does if the floor underwater is close enough. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="bbc_u">Dents</span>: The idea here is very simple and will create a more realistic reaction to a weapon or object traveling and hitting another object at a high speed. The only surface/item I would like the community and myself to see for a test of the denting effect would be armor, or possibly even the vehicles. If a high caliber round from a mini gun hits a car or object, you see a bullet hole in that object. But what of the other weapons? For the Railgun, you see the same affect, but what about grenades and heavy projectiles? The only thing that happens to a car or its armor is there is an explosion; the smoke clears and what do you see? Nothing. You know they took damage, why not show they did? There is a little green bar by your health that says how much health your armor has. By doing so, the game would just be that much more amazing.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Game Design Idea #3: <strong><em><span class="bbc_u">Lighting</span></em></strong> <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Even though the lighting in Carbon Combat is amazing, there could be more additions or adaptations that could be made to make them even more remarkable.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="bbc_u">Headlights</span>: There is a setting when hosting a game where you can make it night time. But when you see what it looks like, all you really see is a dark black sky and a little difference in color on the ground. CarbonTech could make it so that everything literally looks dark, like a forest, only lighted by the moon. That is where the headlights will come in. By adding these headlights, it further shows how much better the game can look and act. It’s a car; why shouldn’t have any lights? You seen them on the car, you just don&#039;t see them. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size"><span class="bbc_u">Explosive Light</span>:&nbsp; In the dark, or at night, is where I see this Idea much better than during the day; though it still could be possible during the day. Once an explosive weapon (e.g. Rocket Launcher) explodes, you see the explosion yes? You do not see any light around that area it exploded in. If you shot into a dark room, you couldn&#039;t see the explosion any better than you could see your own car.<br />　<br /><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;" class="bbc_font">Please, comment on what you believe about this post.

					Hello Fellas!<br />&nbsp;<br />To start off, I don&#039;t remember if this was mentioned (the name) but the weapon itself is a whole new kind of weapon. One that is in the game yet. <br />&nbsp;<br />Let me explain:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s called an Energy Cannon. This cannon Will bring a new type of weapon to the game through area affect. No, not like explosive, but like a lasting area affect. When the round is fired, It travels just as fast as a fully charged grenade, just without the arch the grenade give. It will travel at this speed forever until it hits an object. When it hits a target or surface, a bright, blue ball of energy expands out in the area hit. The energy sphere would only expand out to about the size of the area damage for a grenade now. It would last forever, but it would last. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stats:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Area Effect: Lasts for about 5-10 seconds, depending on level. About as big as area damage of a grenade.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Damage: If hit directly by the Energy Cannon, 85% of your life (unarmored car). The area effects are only about 12-15% every second a target or object is in contact. As the area effect start to deteriorate, the damage is lowered.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Cost: Will be decided by the community. <br />&nbsp;<br />If you like this idea for the new weapon comment or PM me. I will let CT know if enough people see this weapon as a good addition. <br />&nbsp;<br />Thanks!<br />&nbsp;<br />EDIT:<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/C6dKL.png" alt="" border="0" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);" class="bbc_img" />

					Greetings fellow Carbonians!<br /><br />Well, I equipped the rocket launcher and plasma blaster as my weapons to remember what they were like. When I started to use them, I noticed that there wasn&#039;t any area damage coming from the Rockets at all. <br /><br />Now I ask, why does every explosive weapon in-game have an area damage EXCEPT the rocket launcher?<br /><br />And now a little counter-claim:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some people would say that it would be over powering to other players. Well, the grenade launcher has a little more damage than a rocket launcher and still has an area damage. True there are only three rounds, but even level twenty grenades can demolish a player in level 20 heavy armor.<br />*NOTE* I never said that I want to take away the area damage to other weapons (Missile Launcher, Grenade Launcher(s))<br /><br />So why doesn&#039;t the rocket launcher have area damage, CarbonTech? (Or somebody who knows.)<br /><br /><br />

Boost, and a primary weapon: any weapon that includes area damage, and the Devastator. <br />-2 people of any class or type (n00b, sniper, close quarters, etc). The two people just need to have a Devastator. <br /><br />Expectations:<br />-Cannot join another group, clan, or squad if you are in mine. <br />-No backstabbing (team killing)<br />-You cannot recruit or kick a member unless you speak to me or one of my officers (see bottom)<br />-Rules and expectations can and may be changed (only by me) according to a problem or idea I see or have.&nbsp; <br /><br />Officers:<br />People who are like Moderators to CT, but help with the squad for me. In other words, I am &quot;CT&quot; and so-and-so is a mod. Officers have the power to recruit a member, but need must ask me first. There will only be two officers, and I will choose who I believe is right for the job. If I see that the current officer is unfit for the task, they will be removed or replaced. <br /><br /><br />Please, if you have any questions or ideas about my squad, comment or send me a PM. <br /><br />Thank You.

Most of our users are just immature, or have yet to mature, and that is understandable. But posting certain things about certain topics that are uneeded are, as I have just said, <em><span class="bbc_u">Uneeded. </span></em>How is it that nobody finds that this forum is on it&#039;s way to becoming a huge failure. I am not saying it is failing now, but we are all going to get here eventually if somebody doesn&#039;t take action. <br />&nbsp;<br />I am going to go back a little:<br />-Lamp and cremyjr; they have never gotten along, and, that it seems, they are still muted from recent complaints. <br />-spam; It has been going on since the beggining of this new forum. Even as I type this, I can&#039;t bet my amazing monthly alowence Somebody will flame my post.<br />-fighting; When is it going to stop???<br />&nbsp;<br />Please explain what you believe about my thoughts...<br />&nbsp;<br />UDICTED2MARVEL<br />&nbsp;<br />Please tell me I am not the only one?

					The shotgun. It really is an amazing weapon, but do we really need it? Before the shotgun, do you even remember what you really used to use? Would you agree that before the shotgun came out, the game Carbon Combat was just as fun as it would be now without it? Do you really think that a shotgun as powerful as it is in-game is a liability for you? These questions need to be answered. So, I ask the CC Forum Community. What is your opinion of the shotgun and how could that opinion be changed or altered?<br />UDICTED2MARVEL

My invention was supposed to make it stop the violence and destruction. It would be at a great cost of life, money and time, but I knew I could do it. I have made a few things that have helped, but this would be it. It had a top speed of 247 mph. Its armor would be like four firm layers of seven inch steel, but in one coat of a 2 inch metal-like material. The wheels would be made up of the toughest rubber and the finest quality steel-corded rims. The engine made up of a 4.0 V12 with duel liquid injectors, 80 MPG. The frame was made of only the toughest carbon fiber substance in the world. Its Flying capabilities were unlike anything else any human being has seen. The mounted weapon on the top of the vehicle would have the greatest ammunition that money can buy. The Com-Car would start the beginning of the end of the conflict in this awful world. How? Some one could ask me how? The question is not “How” but instead “When?” It will work, but it will only be a matter of time. A week, maybe? A month? Perhaps even a year? It will happen I am sure of it. The Com-Car would avenge the world’s mistakes and destruction.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">Journal Entry: # 2</span><br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">Date Submitted: October 7</span><br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">Title of Entry: More to add.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>When I had introduced my new invention to my board, they were astonished. The qualities of this new “weapon” as they called it would be unstoppable. But they did have some suggestions. The suggested land-mines, flame-throwers, even new weapons I would need to design myself. The new weapons were supposed to be remarkably accurate and powerful. The first is a high-powered round known as a “Rail.” The Rail would be able to travel at incredibly soaring speeds and not stop until it hit its target. The other weapon of choice was called a “Laser Cannon.” The extremely accurate weapon will fry even the toughest carbon steel. Carbon steel happens to be one of the strongest metal alloys known to mankind. It will melt through iridium, iron, steel, and even titanium would be melted into a fine, silvery liquid. The mines I created where not made to kill, but to wound. I had but rubber pellets into the simple land mine. But there is one land mine I created that would blow up one of my Com-Cars in one blow; the Liberator. I suspect to have these weapons completed by the time we have trained our new soldiers; about two months. These elite soldiers will have the knowledge of the best technology we have.&nbsp; They will know everything about the Com-Car, the new weapons, and even some things the board won’t even tell me. There is one thing they have told me that shocked me so horribly that I may faint just by thinking about it. Last month, there was a sudden loss of 156 soldiers in one of our camps. When the board gave me our satellite’s video info, it showed my Com-Car raiding the camp. The carnage of it all… it was agonizing. How did they get my technology? <br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">Journal Entry: # 3</span><br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">Date Submitted: December 22</span><br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">Title of Entry: Worst for the bad.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>I have done it. The new weapons are finished. The Rail and the Laser Cannon have been completed. The soldiers should be done with training by tomorrow. This elite core would be like no other. Equipped with the new weapons, they will be able to stop the people who stole my technology. I don’t want to kill them. I never wanted to. But if that’s the cost for getting my belongings back, it shall be done. The light side to all this is they only have the V.1 Rocket Launcher. Destructive, yes. Accurate, not so much. It was intended to be destructive, so it would be easy to take out bunkers, or other enemy vehicles. They destroyed our camp, so I will demolish theirs. This will make them “re-think” their tactics. They will not get with what they did to those soldiers doing nothing but protecting us. The only question is who are <em>they</em>?<br /><br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">Journal Entry: # 4</span><br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">Date Submitted: December 25</span><br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">Title of Entry: Happy Holidays</span><br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>My team came back today, but the results from the mission were awful.&nbsp; When the elite squad came back, 37 men of the 400 that went came back alive. They got the Com-Car back, but there was a weapon I didn’t even implement on the car. There was a mini-gun on it. The ammo type of the car was hard to distinguish. They looked almost acidic in a way. Most of the soldiers where burned, but the other 37 told me they were shot at. How was this possible? I have tried to create an ammunition type like this, but the acidic substance always ate away the bullet I was using. Who are these guys? How did they get my items? When will I stop them?<br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">Journal Entry: # 5</span><br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">Date Submitted: January 1</span><br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">Title of Entry: It’s not over.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>I brought up a meeting with my board today. I told them I would stop creating the models, adjustments, and additions to the Com-Car. They were displeased. I didn’t care, but I did this because I suspected that one of my board members was a spy for the enemy. I talked to one of my trusted friends, Nathan; codenamed: Nattyfrank. Our conversation was very subtle, and quiet. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Why would you suspect and imposter?” he asked with suspicion. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Why not? The enemy is getting my tech,&quot; I said with rage, &quot;I don’t know how they’re doing it… it just doesn’t make sense.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Or maybe they have a genius, too. Look, I know we are at war right now. We have some things that they won’t have, and some that they will.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I said to him, “I realize this, but I want to know just how they got my tech…”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We continued the conversation, and about 20 minutes later, a board member popped into the room we were speaking in. “There has been a breach,” the board member said with distress.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Where? This base is impossible to get into with out my code…” I said denying his claim. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“It looks like the Com-Car, but I know it isn’t it.&quot; he said, &quot;The body structure of the vehicle look more slim then your design.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a huge explosion and large amounts of glass breaking and shattering. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Nathan, we need to get out of here,” I yelled, “but the main exit is blocked with this new-version Com-Car.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He said to me, “I know another way out.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“There is only one exit,” I said with a hopeless voice.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That’s what you think…” We grabbed the board member and booked it out of the room, just before it was blown up. Some of the shrapnel flew into my leg, but it wasn’t bad enough to disenable me to run for my life. All of a sudden, the board member was ripped out of Nathan’s arms, and I heard a scream for help that made my spine quiver in fear of what’s behind us. When I turned around, I saw a new version Com-Car switching weapons so that it would fire the acidic type ammo at us. Just as I heard the firing of the weapon, everything went dark, literally. The power went out somehow. When the lights came on again, I could still hear the yelling and screaming of other people in the building, but we were in a room that I have never seen before. I made the blueprints for the place. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Nathan…” I said with amazement, “Where are we?”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“We are in your lab… the lab that we secretly created in the event that we had a problem with one of your inventions…”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I asked him with frustration, “And you never thought of telling me? We almost just died. Everyone up there will be dead within twenty minutes with that car.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“We didn’t tell you because we thought you would also be part of the problem,” he said with a sense of prudence in his voice.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Who is <em>we</em>? What? The construction workers? Who vowed they would die so they couldn’t let loose my building’s secrets?”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“It’s funny you would ask that…” he said with a smirk, “some of the construction workers happen to be in this very room.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I looked around and I saw two other people. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan said, “As you know, my “codename” as you called it is <em>Nattyfrank.</em>”I looked over to see a woman standing over in the corner working on something on her desk. She had a suit on that made her look like she was a person with welded metal all over their body. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Who is that?” I asked. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That is <em>Apophis</em>,” Nattyfrank said, &quot;and she is a genius when it comes to writing out code for technology and programs. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She walked over and said, “It is great to finally meet the man who created some of the best tech in the world.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’m glad I could do such a great job…” I said, but not really knowing what she was talking about. The other person standing in the room was a man that seemed to know what he was doing with his welding. I walked over to him and I was going to ask him a question when he turned around and asked, “So how are you doing, sir? Would you like to see the new designs?”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nattyfrank said, “Totoro, try not to bug your commanding officer.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, is that…?” he started to ask with a small grin.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes, and he doesn’t even know it yet. Give me a little bit,” said Nathan sounding as if he was annoyed. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“He doesn’t know?”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“No, but he will in a bit.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Pardon the interruption,” I said, “but where am I again?”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Apophis said, “You’re in your lab. Well, now it’s yours. Before, this would be the area where the people in this building, or as you call it, the board, would hide if you ever turned on us. You never knew about it because we thought you would be the one trying to kill us and not this unknown killer and stealer of your tech. Speaking of tech, does he even know his codename, Natty?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Nattyfrank said, annoyed again for the question, “No, give me a bit, he will know.&quot; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Codename?” I asked, “What kind of codename?”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“The kind that would make us have hope for the world.” said Apophis. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What were they talking about? I had no idea. After we talked, Natty left to a room. When he came back, he had a suit just like Apophis and Totoro. I started to look around at all the things in this little lab. All of the tech that I had created was in this room, but better somehow. I saw about different desks in the room. All the desks had piles of blueprints and designs of new weapons or new types of tech. It really wasn’t that big, though. Sometimes I had to duck down because of a hanging beam coming down from the ceiling. I saw some blueprints that looked like my Com-Car, the one I just practically made, but improved over. I saw two new blueprints on the car. One of the prints said <em>Sprinter</em> while the other one said <em>Racer</em>. They looked amazingly fast. The Sprinter was sleek and had a top speed of 268 mph. As a matter of fact, the Sprinter looked just like the Com-Car that was attacking us upstairs. When I looked at the blueprint for the Racer, I saw that it could hit 0-60 in 1.2 seconds with a top speed of 255 mph. I don’t know how this could be done, but what was said on the make of the engine layout made complete sense.&nbsp; I looked over to a wall, and there was another suit that seemed better than the rest of my “dead construction workers” were wearing. The plaque above the suit said: <em>CarbonTech</em>.<br />&nbsp;<br />EDIT^<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;Everything above has been edited from original posting.
