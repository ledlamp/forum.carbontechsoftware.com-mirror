					Yes, Yes, i know this. The real version looked nothing at all like this. Trust me, I know how o type more than most people. It was just the copy n&#039; paste, it didn&#039;t work as planned. Sorry for yet another failed post. XD I will try to fix it by tomarow night. <em>TRY</em> doesn&#039;t mean it will be done. Tomarow is friday and I should be free to fix it. You Carbonians will like this storyline tenfold once I am done editing the first failed attempt.<br />&nbsp;<br />@Lamp: What kind of speeling errors did I make? I did not see any as I reviewed it one last time before posting. It would help so i know how to make it better. Like i said (Like i think i said) Its a work in progress

My invention was supposed to make it stop the violence and destruction. It would be at a great cost of life, money and time, but I knew I could do it. I have made a few things that have helped, but this would be it. It had a top speed of 247 mph. Its armor would be like four firm layers of seven inch steel, but in one coat of a 2 inch metal-like material. The wheels would be made up of the toughest rubber and the finest quality steel-corded rims. The engine made up of a 4.0 V12 with duel liquid injectors, 80 MPG. The frame was made of only the toughest carbon fiber substance in the world. Its Flying capabilities were unlike anything else any human being has seen. The mounted weapon on the top of the vehicle would have the greatest ammunition that money can buy. The Com-Car would start the beginning of the end of the conflict in this awful world. How? Some one could ask me how? The question is not “How” but instead “When?” It will work, but it will only be a matter of time. A week, maybe? A month? Perhaps even a year? It will happen I am sure of it. The Com-Car would avenge the world’s mistakes and destruction.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">Journal Entry: # 2</span><br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">Date Submitted: October 7</span><br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">Title of Entry: More to add.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>When I had introduced my new invention to my board, they were astonished. The qualities of this new “weapon” as they called it would be unstoppable. But they did have some suggestions. The suggested land-mines, flame-throwers, even new weapons I would need to design myself. The new weapons were supposed to be remarkably accurate and powerful. The first is a high-powered round known as a “Rail.” The Rail would be able to travel at incredibly soaring speeds and not stop until it hit its target. The other weapon of choice was called a “Laser Cannon.” The extremely accurate weapon will fry even the toughest carbon steel. Carbon steel happens to be one of the strongest metal alloys known to mankind. It will melt through iridium, iron, steel, and even titanium would be melted into a fine, silvery liquid. The mines I created where not made to kill, but to wound. I had but rubber pellets into the simple land mine. But there is one land mine I created that would blow up one of my Com-Cars in one blow; the Liberator. I suspect to have these weapons completed by the time we have trained our new soldiers; about two months. These elite soldiers will have the knowledge of the best technology we have.&nbsp; They will know everything about the Com-Car, the new weapons, and even some things the board won’t even tell me. There is one thing they have told me that shocked me so horribly that I may faint just by thinking about it. Last month, there was a sudden loss of 156 soldiers in one of our camps. When the board gave me our satellite’s video info, it showed my Com-Car raiding the camp. The carnage of it all… it was agonizing. How did they get my technology? <br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">Journal Entry: # 3</span><br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">Date Submitted: December 22</span><br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">Title of Entry: Worst for the bad.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>I have done it. The new weapons are finished. The Rail and the Laser Cannon have been completed. The soldiers should be done with training by tomorrow. This elite core would be like no other. Equipped with the new weapons, they will be able to stop the people who stole my technology. I don’t want to kill them. I never wanted to. But if that’s the cost for getting my belongings back, it shall be done. The light side to all this is they only have the V.1 Rocket Launcher. Destructive, yes. Accurate, not so much. It was intended to be destructive, so it would be easy to take out bunkers, or other enemy vehicles. They destroyed our camp, so I will demolish theirs. This will make them “re-think” their tactics. They will not get with what they did to those soldiers doing nothing but protecting us. The only question is who are <em>they</em>?<br /><br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">Journal Entry: # 4</span><br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">Date Submitted: December 25</span><br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">Title of Entry: Happy Holidays</span><br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>My team came back today, but the results from the mission were awful.&nbsp; When the elite squad came back, 37 men of the 400 that went came back alive. They got the Com-Car back, but there was a weapon I didn’t even implement on the car. There was a mini-gun on it. The ammo type of the car was hard to distinguish. They looked almost acidic in a way. Most of the soldiers where burned, but the other 37 told me they were shot at. How was this possible? I have tried to create an ammunition type like this, but the acidic substance always ate away the bullet I was using. Who are these guys? How did they get my items? When will I stop them?<br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">Journal Entry: # 5</span><br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">Date Submitted: January 1</span><br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">Title of Entry: It’s not over.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: rockwell;" class="bbc_font">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>I brought up a meeting with my board today. I told them I would stop creating the models, adjustments, and additions to the Com-Car. They were displeased. I didn’t care, but I did this because I suspected that one of my board members was a spy for the enemy. I talked to one of my trusted friends, Nathan; codenamed: Nattyfrank. Our conversation was very subtle, and quiet. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Why would you suspect and imposter?” he asked with suspicion. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Why not? The enemy is getting my tech,&quot; I said with rage, &quot;I don’t know how they’re doing it… it just doesn’t make sense.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Or maybe they have a genius, too. Look, I know we are at war right now. We have some things that they won’t have, and some that they will.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I said to him, “I realize this, but I want to know just how they got my tech…”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We continued the conversation, and about 20 minutes later, a board member popped into the room we were speaking in. “There has been a breach,” the board member said with distress.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Where? This base is impossible to get into with out my code…” I said denying his claim. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“It looks like the Com-Car, but I know it isn’t it.&quot; he said, &quot;The body structure of the vehicle look more slim then your design.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a huge explosion and large amounts of glass breaking and shattering. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Nathan, we need to get out of here,” I yelled, “but the main exit is blocked with this new-version Com-Car.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He said to me, “I know another way out.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“There is only one exit,” I said with a hopeless voice.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That’s what you think…” We grabbed the board member and booked it out of the room, just before it was blown up. Some of the shrapnel flew into my leg, but it wasn’t bad enough to disenable me to run for my life. All of a sudden, the board member was ripped out of Nathan’s arms, and I heard a scream for help that made my spine quiver in fear of what’s behind us. When I turned around, I saw a new version Com-Car switching weapons so that it would fire the acidic type ammo at us. Just as I heard the firing of the weapon, everything went dark, literally. The power went out somehow. When the lights came on again, I could still hear the yelling and screaming of other people in the building, but we were in a room that I have never seen before. I made the blueprints for the place. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Nathan…” I said with amazement, “Where are we?”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“We are in your lab… the lab that we secretly created in the event that we had a problem with one of your inventions…”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I asked him with frustration, “And you never thought of telling me? We almost just died. Everyone up there will be dead within twenty minutes with that car.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“We didn’t tell you because we thought you would also be part of the problem,” he said with a sense of prudence in his voice.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Who is <em>we</em>? What? The construction workers? Who vowed they would die so they couldn’t let loose my building’s secrets?”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“It’s funny you would ask that…” he said with a smirk, “some of the construction workers happen to be in this very room.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I looked around and I saw two other people. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan said, “As you know, my “codename” as you called it is <em>Nattyfrank.</em>”I looked over to see a woman standing over in the corner working on something on her desk. She had a suit on that made her look like she was a person with welded metal all over their body. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Who is that?” I asked. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That is <em>Apophis</em>,” Nattyfrank said, &quot;and she is a genius when it comes to writing out code for technology and programs. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She walked over and said, “It is great to finally meet the man who created some of the best tech in the world.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’m glad I could do such a great job…” I said, but not really knowing what she was talking about. The other person standing in the room was a man that seemed to know what he was doing with his welding. I walked over to him and I was going to ask him a question when he turned around and asked, “So how are you doing, sir? Would you like to see the new designs?”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nattyfrank said, “Totoro, try not to bug your commanding officer.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, is that…?” he started to ask with a small grin.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes, and he doesn’t even know it yet. Give me a little bit,” said Nathan sounding as if he was annoyed. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“He doesn’t know?”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“No, but he will in a bit.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Pardon the interruption,” I said, “but where am I again?”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Apophis said, “You’re in your lab. Well, now it’s yours. Before, this would be the area where the people in this building, or as you call it, the board, would hide if you ever turned on us. You never knew about it because we thought you would be the one trying to kill us and not this unknown killer and stealer of your tech. Speaking of tech, does he even know his codename, Natty?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Nattyfrank said, annoyed again for the question, “No, give me a bit, he will know.&quot; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Codename?” I asked, “What kind of codename?”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“The kind that would make us have hope for the world.” said Apophis. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What were they talking about? I had no idea. After we talked, Natty left to a room. When he came back, he had a suit just like Apophis and Totoro. I started to look around at all the things in this little lab. All of the tech that I had created was in this room, but better somehow. I saw about different desks in the room. All the desks had piles of blueprints and designs of new weapons or new types of tech. It really wasn’t that big, though. Sometimes I had to duck down because of a hanging beam coming down from the ceiling. I saw some blueprints that looked like my Com-Car, the one I just practically made, but improved over. I saw two new blueprints on the car. One of the prints said <em>Sprinter</em> while the other one said <em>Racer</em>. They looked amazingly fast. The Sprinter was sleek and had a top speed of 268 mph. As a matter of fact, the Sprinter looked just like the Com-Car that was attacking us upstairs. When I looked at the blueprint for the Racer, I saw that it could hit 0-60 in 1.2 seconds with a top speed of 255 mph. I don’t know how this could be done, but what was said on the make of the engine layout made complete sense.&nbsp; I looked over to a wall, and there was another suit that seemed better than the rest of my “dead construction workers” were wearing. The plaque above the suit said: <em>CarbonTech</em>.<br />&nbsp;<br />EDIT^<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;Everything above has been edited from original posting.

					Thank you, mods... but i have one thing to say. I suspect that this F***fest guy is just trying to troll us. He posted one comment in every post... after that i never saw him again. I just think he wont be here anymore, and that is was a joke, or someone to make us upset... kind of like an impersonator and me. It made me upset, but i never saw the guy agian. Its just a thought.

					Fat, you seem to have a probelm with the chat... Your problems are mine as well. I hate, and i mean HATE when i am impersonated. You guys should know this from recent reports. Anyhow, I do believe this chat should be edited/changed to a new one. This one can get out of control, people become other people, and users can say what ever they want, without a filter for bad content/language. I hate bad language... Makes me wana Ban whoever is using it. My advice, Fat, is to start a pole, to see who thinks the same, differently, or who just doesnt really care. <br />&nbsp;<br />U2M
