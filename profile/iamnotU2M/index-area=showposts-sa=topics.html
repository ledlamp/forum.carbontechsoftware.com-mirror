					Ok so U2M sent me his first chapter!!! he said to post it so here it goes!!!<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;_________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I couldn’t breath. The dust had settled over the area so thick, I couldn’t breath. I was trying so hard to dig myself out of the dark place I was in. All I could hear was the high pitched ringing in my ears. The force of the explosion made me fell like I was slammed by a truck and thrown off a cliff. If I didn’t know any better, I would think I was dead. I could see a faint yellow light, but it was too dim to tell what it really was. Once I got out of the grey, burning ash, more dust flooded the hole I was in. I finally stood up, looking around. I couldn’t believe what I was looking at. The sight of hundreds of motionless bodies was horrible. I saw no other sign of life in the area. I wondered for days, looking for food, seeing nothing but dead bodies everywhere I went. I finally reached where distress signal came from. The signal was the thing that probably saved my life. What I had created to help stop the war just ended it… but not how I wanted it to. The five mile crater in the earth marked the day that the world war had ended, and all life had ceased to exist. I looked through the scraps of colossal pieces of metal to try to find survivors. All I saw was the bodies that wouldn’t seem to disappear. It was horrific. As I progressed on in my search for somebody who survived, I saw hundreds of my Com-Cars. Every single car I could see was destroyed beyond repair. I tried to look for a Com-Car that wasn’t damaged so badly I couldn’t repair it. I found a sprinter that I couldn’t identify because of the force that may or may not have made the car not function correctly. When I dug down deep enough through the ash, I found the handle of the door. When I opened the door, sitting there, as motionless as the others, was one of my best friends, Nattyfrank. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “No… you… you can’t be…” I just looked at him. I wouldn’t touch him. All of a sudden, his body twitched. The twitch created a major pain in my spine. He twitched again, and yelled in pain. The yell pierced my ears with the most unbearable sound I have ever heard. It was worse than the sound of a person yelling because they were shot by a gun.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; He opened his eyes, body still motionless, and said to me, “Why…” <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; All he said was “why?”&nbsp; Was it me? Was he asking me why I did this? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I said to him, trying not to burst out into tears, “Nathan, are you ok? Can you move?”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “I- I can’t move,” he said, mumbling every word in pain.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I looked at him. He looked paralyzed. But I had to ask myself, why did he twitch? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “Do you feel yourself twitch?” <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; He said with a shaking voice, “I had a dream I felt it.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “A dream?”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “Yes,“ he paused, “but it felt so real. Where am I?”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “I am not sure. I thought everybody in the world was dead. What happened in your dream?” I asked him this with suspicion. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “We were in the middle of a full-out war with an entire fleet of Com-Cars- but all of a sudden, I saw a flash. After I could see again, a dark green gas filled the area and all of a sudden, there was a massive wave of force. After that, I woke up to you.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I asked thinking what it could really be, “Where did the gas come from?”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “I don’t know- wait you don’t know?” <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “No, that is odd. I never created a green gas of any type. I am going to try to pull you out of there. Tell me if you start to feel pain.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I started nice and easy, but he jerked and he yelled like he was just stabbed by a knife. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “What happened? I asked Nathan.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “I am not sure, I didn’t feel anything.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “Then why did you yell? Let me try again...” <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Before I tried to pull him out of the car, he started to twitch again, and then he started to stare into space. His body was twitching like a worm in a heated area. I started to hyperventilate. Then he became motionless once again, his eyes open, staring back at me. I looked a little closer and could see that he was breathing, but he also had green eyes. His eyes used to be blue. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “Nathan, if you can hear me, I am going to find a safe place for you and me.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I pulled him out of the car and put him on a mound of nearby ash. I started to work on his car. The front windshield was cracked beyond repair, his engine was still barely running, the car had a flat tire, and the mounted weapon was not so much “mounted” anymore. I believe he had a Rail, but it was nowhere in sight. His Rail could be seen from a mile away; it had an amazing, new Carbon based tech to it that made the shot fired travel so fast it turned green. I only made one for him. It was the only one made, but now it was gone. It took about eight hours to fix his car to a working state. His Sprinter was not as fast as it was after I fixed it, but that is just because I didn’t even have the tools to fix it. I stuck him in the passenger seat so carefully, it took about twenty minutes. Just before I got into the car, a green gas started to come into the area. It was the gas that Nathan was talking about. I jumped into the car as fast as I could and tired to turn the engine back on. It wouldn’t start. I kept trying to start the car, but it wouldn’t even sputter. Finally, it made a loud sound and I put it in gear. I started to drive away as fast as I could. The car started to slow down, and the green smoke seemed to be getting closer. All of a sudden, the car engine just stopped, and we rolled to slow stop. I looked back and then I looked back at Nathan. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “I guess we are done… I’m sorry, Nathan. I can’t do anything more.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Just as prepared to be engulfed by this smoke that may or may not have paralyzed Nathan, I heard a loud sounding wind pass over us. It looked and sounded like a giant sand storm, only a dark green shade of dust and clouds. I looked out the tinted windows of the car, and saw nothing but green. The gas went on for hours. I thought I would be there forever. I counted each hour that passed by. I waited for either the green wall of gas to pass by or for Nathan to even move a single hair on his body. At about the eighth hour, I heard s loud thumping sound on the back of the car. I looked out the back window, and saw a human figure. I couldn’t tell what it was. I heard the thumping for 15 more minutes before noticing that the wall of green smoke had passed by already. I got out of the car. I looked around and saw everything I saw before I entered the car. It was dark, and gloomy. I saw ash ever so much more than before. The bodies were still motionless and covered with ash and shrapnel. I started to walk slowly to the back of the car. Every step I took sounded like I was stepping in dirt in a dry field. I saw the back of the car. I started to walk even slower, asking myself what could possible be back there. When I finally got the back of the car, of all the people that could have survived the asteroid, I saw Totoro. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “Totoro? You’re alive?”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “Of coarse I am… I told you I was creating a new suit for us.” He said this with a smirk that I will never put out of your mind. What was so much better about this suit from Nathan’s?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “Totoro,” I started to say with a cold, shady voice, “how did you survive the collision?”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; He just looked at the floor covered with a green tint. He said to me with a stutter, “I- I- I don’t really know. All I know is there was an earthquake and then a giant flash of light that blinded everybody in my building. I thought it was the perfect time to test out the new suit.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “What happened after the flash”? I asked with persistence, “I need to know.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “Well, the new suit was a watch, and I can press a button on it and it would form itself all around me. After I did this, the suit adjusted my vision to the flash so I could see again. I regret seeing what I saw though,” he said with agony. His tone sounded familiar. It sounded like how I did when I found Nathan.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “Totoro, what happened?”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; He looked at me, part of the glass on his helmet cracked, and said directly to my face, “Impact.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “The asteroid.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “Yes, I looked over to the blinding glare coming in through the window, and just stared. I could see it. The wave that I thought would kill me. Before I could even think of what to do, the wave of force coming from the blow knocked me out.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “You’re still alive- wait, who was there with you?” I asked with my eyes starting to water.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “CarbonTech… she’s gone. I couldn’t save her.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “She- she’s gone? She can’t be- I-“ <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Totoro grabbed me and looked straight into my eyes. His brown eyes where now green, like Nathan’s. It must have been the green clouds. <br />He said to me with the softest voice, “CT, it will be ok. It’s not your fault, she didn’t-“<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I looked back at Totoro in silence. I asked him, “She’s really gone?”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “Yes- wait,” he said looking over at the car, trying to change the subject, “isn’t that Natty’s car? Where is he?”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “He is in the car, but I don’t know if he is dead or in a coma.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “Then let’s get him to a place where we can scan him.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Scan him? What was Totoro talking about this time? I know the guy was smart, but what will a scan do? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; As I sat in silence, thinking about the girl I loved gone, Totoro worked on the car. Even though he isn’t really the one who fixes the cars, he knows a thing or two. Apparently, the thing or two that he knew was what was wrong with the car. The engine took a hit from the waves from the asteroid and the exhaust pipe was- well there wasn’t and exhaust pipe. I walked over to a nearby car to take the pipe when the car I was walking up to turned on. The engine roared, piles of ash flew out of the back pipe and your wheels started to spin like race cars do at the start of a finish line. The car drove about thirty feet before turning around and charging at me, in an instant, I was tackled by Totoro. Saving me, he was hit by the car.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “NO! Totoro! I am not losing another soldier again,” I looked over to the car sitting across the way, the engine running, and I signaled to the car to come at me. He turned like he was a madman, throwing ash and dirt into the air, pulling out a Laser Cannon aiming it right at me. Just as I thought he would, he fired it. That was just my plan. The Laser takes up so much energy and power; you can’t fire it with your engine at top speed. I saw a blinding red flash of light, and I heard an explosion. The explosion sounded much like the asteroid, but I was thrown twenty-five feet away from the exploding car. I woke up, trying to see, but only seeing a red glare. As soon as I gained my vision, Nathan and Totoro were gone.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “What in the hell is going on here?” I asked in confusion, “Natty! Totoro!”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; After hearing my echo from calling their names, I heard complete silence. All I could here was the ash flowing with wind. It started to get colder. The asteroid shot up so much dirt and gas that it blocked out the sun. Everything was a gloomy grey, with the color of orange everywhere from the burnt trees and materials from the buildings and cars that where everywhere. There were no buildings anywhere. Not that I could see. I started to walk again. My feet, covered in ash, started to cramp. I feel to my knees, crying. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “Why? Why did this need to happen? My ideas, my thoughts, my inventions… they were going to stop it all- why? That’s the question.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I started to walk on again. I started thinking more and more about where I should go, or even what I should do. Just as I was about to lay on a soft pile of dirt, I looked up to see a building in the distance.
