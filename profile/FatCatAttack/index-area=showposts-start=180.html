					Knew it! Check your PMs, I figured you were Director142 a few hours before this post. That said it might be general knowledge, but since I never play I felt like I figured it out well.<br /><br />That said, I never play due to computer issues. I bet I got a ton of rust on me though, so as soon as I upgrade this (it&#039;s supposed to be soon, but then again it was supposed to be soon 3 months ago) I&#039;ll hit you up. I never was a good player before anyways.<br />

					Just read it over. <strong>I am liking it so far, but there are a few things I would change.</strong><br /><br />First off, the scientist&#039;s personality needs some clarification (making a weapon too horrible for use to end war, or to help his side win?) and a setting needs some clarification (you were in a military base designing this, or at a compound separate from your lab to meet with board members, or what?) but you show a lot of talent for writing and I was able to continue along without this info. If you plan on making it longer however you will need to decide on something.<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed the story, but perhaps your journal entry format isn&#039;t suiting it well. For instance, the journal could be the start of the chapter, and then it would transfer to a changing first-person limited third-person perspective, such as for entry 2 you shorten the entry a bit to exclude the raid, then include the raid in entry 3 (with the bulk of chapter 2 taking place during the raid on the camp), and do something similar with entry 3 about the failed mission where you move the results of the mission to entry 4 and have the mission be the bulk of chapter 3. Entry 4&#039;s chapter could be CT meeting with the board members and catching while in-meeting that one of the members is leaking information, but doesn&#039;t say it in case he is not believed (a fair concern, since there is a back-up lab in case he was the one leaking information). Entry 5 could be separated for BOTH the entry and chapter 5, with the entry ending with Mr. CT saying he will talk to Natty, and the rest of the chapter being the talk and the assault. Entry 1 is alright but the chapter explaining the setting (as said before) is greatly needed. Don&#039;t be afraid to do short chapters with the entry, about the size as entry 5 is good.<br /><br />Oh, and try a Mars Explorer name for the board member leaking technology, to add a bit of cool factor. It could affect the story, it could not, but wouldn&#039;t it be a cool way to add tension? Mars Xplr players are rather...slick, I guess.<br /><br />P.S. Is this a one-man project? Would be willing to do some editing/writing for you, if wanted. Also, you misspelled Totoro.

It&#039;s how degraded the chat has gotten, where you can&#039;t say schedule matches or even have idol conversation, plus how unanimous spammers &amp; flammers can wreck the chat with no punishment. If we add a good moderation &amp; login system controlled by CT then spammer &amp; flammers can be dealt with and moderators dealing with general idiots in chat.

					Sweet! Customizable android skins! I can&#039;t wait until I get to load up different celebrities onto my android and watch them get blown to pieces.<br /><br />Well, actually I am seeing a lot of malnourished women in little to no clothing in my head. Suddenly the idea of fully customizable skins isn&#039;t that good; you know some idiot is going to make an android of a naked guy with his junk clearly shown. But maybe skins like that of the bodykits for cars?

This is a <em>serious </em>topic devoid of personal opinions. Though that is true...<br /><br />Better to admit to it than let speculate. I still think it should go and replaced with something a bit more friendly as we have seen in a few posts, perhaps just something simple considering the social aspect of CC is the game, not the forum. And I don&#039;t play the game, so you know that if I limit anything on the chat I am hurting myself the most.<br /><br />Also, I have actually avoided the chat for the reason that it is a disorganized mess. If I want to go chat for some reason (off-topic discussion usually, [most] of you guys seem like nice people to talk with) I usually stumble into something that resembles a bar brawl more than a chat room, and I really don&#039;t see any point of poking my head in. Don&#039;t get me wrong, a forum chat is a great idea in my opinion, it just seems to be hurting more than helping.

Even though it was made as an afterthought, it is something to keep in mind for further updates. There is a lot of potential there.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Very good point, but there is one flaw. You see, androids are given full health when they get out of the car no matter the car&#039;s actual health. That makes the car the primary, &quot;first&quot; life of the player while the android is the &quot;second&quot;, since androids can&#039;t re-enter cars. Given the fact that the android is already at the least annoying to cars even though they are statistically inferior to cars (the assault rifle is a Lvl. 1 minigun with half fire rate), that we already have an extensive car armory and that we don&#039;t want to encourage new players to think of the game as an FPS adding any more power to the android in any way is generally rejected by the community. <br /><br />However, if we were to nerf the android a bit (remove the instant movement and create an acceleration based movement system, abet with a low top speed but an <em>almost </em>instant acceleration and turning rate is my suggestion, as said before in other topics) we would be able to start to add equipment options to the android, assuming they fit in balance with the game. If that were to happen I would more than be willing to encourage getting an android equipment store up and running.<br /><br />Now for the suggestions:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="../../feedback-ideas/stuff-for-the-android-after-leaving-your-vehicle/msg1722/index.html#msg1722">Quote from: hunterskid on <span title=" 09, 2012, 01:48:38 pm" style="cursor:default">Early September, 2012</span></a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I was thinking some things like from the game Raze 2 some special items or abilities for the android secondary weapons and upgrades for extra fuel for flying and some armor like military bullet proof stuff.Perhaps like weaker versions of all the weapons a car normally has like a mini laser cannon or some hand grenades<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Let me organize that a little better for you. Your suggestions are:<br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Special Items/Abilities</li><li>Secondary Weapons</li><li>Upgrade for Flying Fuel</li><li>Body Armor</li><li>Weapons, based on car weapons but weaker.</li></ul>I&#039;ll tackle this one-by-one. Don&#039;t exactly know why you included Raze 2 in there since these are pretty generic shooter ideas (most of which are not even in Raze 2), but ah well.<br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>I actually like this. If you are able to select say a shielding device or flag holster then the android would be more fit to a specific task if you try to take advantage of an item. For instance selecting mines would encourage a defensive playstyle, or a faster jet pack a more mobile (MUST nerf android movement first) playstyle. Hidden objective gameplay.</li><li>A great idea, if we needed to reload and had more than one weapon. An option if ammo is even introduced or we add more than two android weapons.</li><li>Maybe as a special item, otherwise no. As of when I last played the game the jetpack recharges fuel in-air fast enough that if a player were to keep trying to reach the top of the map by emptying their fuel, waiting for half to recharge then moving up again they would be successful.</li><li>Possibly, but needs to also make android less mobile to compensate, like the car armor. Lighter armor is pretty much not notable but heavy armor would leave a large dent.</li><li>Suggested before and debated to an inconclusive end. The idea of increasing the android&#039;s power has deterred it mostly but also weapons such as the shotgun and laser cannon. I&#039;m for it as it would give some more motivation to use the car as the weapons come in a set, assuming the android is nerfed.</li></ul>There we go, I love starting a good debate.

That shouldn&#039;t matter, though.</em><br /><br />So basically, I am sick of TinyChat. Normally I don&#039;t use it too much, but whenever I do it&#039;s always chaotic (see the attachment). The problems are pretty obvious:<br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>No log-in: Anyone can come and just start spamming/flamming with no way to identify and stop them. Plus impersonation has become a problem.</li><li>Bad moderation: The one (or occasionally none) moderator the chat assigns could be at the very best completely incompetent. At worst, it is a spammer/flammer who uses the privileges against normal users, and even forum moderators.</li><li>Front page: If this were a good chat then this wouldn&#039;t be a problem, but with the state it is right now it just degrades the forum face appeal. Imagine someone following the link to see if the forum is something interesting to follow, and they see the big white box on the bottom right.</li></ul>Basically, it needs to go. Replaced, hopefully, maybe with less features, but right now it&#039;s a mess.

					I remember (this was a while ago, don&#039;t have&nbsp; a pic) of this match that was nice. Nothing special, really. What was significant was that it was rather balanced; one guy was pro but was not invincible, some newbs with below average KDs and some averages going from 1 to 1.5 KD. It was by far the funnest and most epic match I have ever had.<br /><br />I need to upgrade my computer, get back in the game. This piece of crap can&#039;t run a YouTube video, let alone CC.<br />

Although there is probably a good reason why this isn&#039;t implemented yet, I say that until such a reason is brought to light then the ability to use kreds to purchase items would be great since a good amount of players who would normally pay to have premium content are deterred by the fact that you cannot do so on the Kong play page.
