					I think the title says for itself what I&#039;m proposing. An option for players (likely on the profile screen) to disable TinyChat on the home page, perhaps in favor of a larger most recent posts section. Me, I just want the load times for the chat GONE.<br /><br />Note this would be an option and those who want to chat can still chat.<br />

					Love the new vote system, where it doesn&#039;t show everyone else&#039;s votes until the creator wants to reveal them.<br /><br />As for the topic, I say they shouldn&#039;t be destroyed on-the-spot, but they should be given a observation and then a decision on whether this club will impact CC in a positive way or a negative one. For instance, if a club is made that signed members to the said club can share their battle strategies and help improve CC with them the club gets a green light, but if it is designed to be an independent union of players who could possibly make war on each other than delete it.<br /><br />P.S. Love this decision making process, keep it up!

					The bike in my opinion actually seems rather balanced on paper. The thing most people are forgetting about the android&#039;s speed is not it&#039;s actual speed, but it&#039;s acceleration, being able to change directions almost instantly to dodge bullets (unlike the car). The bike would not have that advantage. The weapon ideas are nice like missile pods and mounted chainguns but most would have the disadvantage of being only front firing, so a bike would have to use it&#039;s superior agility to line up with it&#039;s target and the car would have to use it&#039;s 360 weapon systems to shoot down a hoverbike before it can line up and deal damage. There would also be a rather clear and large weak spot on the bike (the rider) and it would be rather vulnerable to regular androids.<br /><br />Even if it is overpowered, it can always be an alternative to the car with the ability to eject (though the ejecting android is bound to have taken damage).

CC would have about 75% of everything (all these are if you bought all upgrades or whtevr) racer would have more everything but top speed and flying agility would still be be less than the rest. same with the rest (if you know wut i mean)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If you mean we can install performance upgrades into our car without penalties, then I have to disagree. I like the idea of adding modifiers like bigger engines and different tires (though I do realize it would be hard to model cosmetic variations, I still want it) but if there isn&#039;t a downfall then there is just another way new players are at a disadvantage. Why is it the pros get handling upgrades when they have likely by now gotten control of their car when new players are left with a stock car flying into walls? If you want to modify, you need to sacrifice something, whether it&#039;s a bigger engine giving more weight or high-grip racing tires making flying more chunky. We can still customize, but we don&#039;t need to do it at new player&#039;s expense.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t mean that, then please re-phrase or use better grammar. A bit hard to understand, see.<br /><br />As for this:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="../../carbon-combat/garrage-idea/msg735/index.html#msg735">Quote from: cremyjr on <span title=" 27, 2012, 05:24:00 pm" style="cursor:default">Late July, 2012</span></a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">BUT... the garage idea isnt like that &quot; The garage is where you equip your car with all the goodies you bought at the store.

Just paint and car mods? If that&#039;s the case then we can just buy that stuff in the store. Besides, we would need a place to customize your paint job and the inventory screen has nothing to let us do that. A new screen is needed, and I suggested a replacement to the current inventory screen with the garage idea that lets us do paint, see our stats and swap our equipment and maybe mods.

					...quote pyramid much?<br /><br />Also, the reason it doesn&#039;t work it because there isn&#039;t any a melee bodykit designed for the racer and sprinter.<br /><br />Now to elevate some of the frustration here, how about if you get a high speed ram on a car you instantly kill them with the armor? It would have to be a pretty high but still obtainable speed, and it wouldn&#039;t work in-air due to problems with the other car moving all over the place, but it would give you a nice weapon for ground control forcing nearby opponents into the air if they don&#039;t want to be sliced in half in a awesome way.<br />

					Well let me just say this is all over the place. I&#039;m just going by small scraps of information here, but here is what I picture:<br /><br />The garage is where you equip your car with all the goodies you bought at the store. It would be a separate screen from the main menu and would show your car in an auto garage (possibly futuristic).<br /><br />In the garage, you can see your current equipment loadout and modify it while seeing visual changes you are making to the car, as well as the stats of your car so you can spend time trying to make either highly practical or highly funky combinations of equipment.<br /><br />There would be extra options in the garage for cosmetic customization as well. Free-for-all colors can be modified (no decals as profanity can be made, unless there is preset decal packages to choose from, which would remove the point of cosmetic bodykits however) and possibly the ability to modify your car&#039;s bodykit (same word as before, but this refers to stuff like spoilers, sideskirts, bumpers and hoods).<br /><br />Now for responces!<br /><br />The car is rather visible anyways with the red cursor over enemies and green over friends, plus the giant name tag. Don&#039;t worry about paint, you can go camo if you like but it wouldn&#039;t really do THAT much.<br /><br />And Ratchet, yes I am. You cannot out-reference me when it comes to games that have similar properties to CC.

CC is a rather successful game and if you can pitch it to them that the lack of a data limit for the game will allow you to get more plays and ad revenue for them they might just let you do it. Or they could just say no exceptions and slam the door in your face. It could be worth a try though.

					I personally wouldn&#039;t be interested. If you take one look at the IOS/Android market you see our competition is mostly social MMO style games. The gaming audience we are sharing wouldn&#039;t be interested in a action shooter, and the community we would gain isn&#039;t exactly the best.<br /><br />That said, there is a LOT of money in the mobile market. If we slap a .99 cent price tag on the game, a total failure game would give about 40 buys. The current version of CC could go for a higher price, and be able to get more buys. However the networking would be completely horrible, hence the lack of action shooters in the market. The best solution I can come up with is to convert the mobile game to a single player game with bots, and maybe use a previous version.<br />

					I think headlights are as simple as making the light and adding a button for them, though I could be wrong. If so, then 5 minutes to make a decent graphic improvement, as well as giving the game more polish wouldn&#039;t be that bad an idea and can help out future map developers who really want to do a dark map.<br /><br />Also I don&#039;t exactly agree with everything you want a priority on ATM. Expect a few others to share the same feelings, like either lamp or cremyjr (not both, because then they would have something in common which they can&#039;t fight over ^^)

					I think I need to clarify: the bouncing betty mine would use a laser trip signal pointed upwards to detect if someone is flying low above them. When the trip is hit, the mine pops up; right under your car.<br /><br />It is a bit more powerful that your suggestions, but I think you are low-balling the mines. In addition of the laser trip wire to my mine, how about burying the majority of the ground mines under ground and only showing the trip, maybe as a high-tech trip in CC theme that gives off a light based on team? It would show there is a mine in the area, but you don&#039;t know exactly where it is unless you look very closely. And that takes time.<br /><br />I like drop bombs as they are not &quot;passive&quot; mines like the rest of them, but they need to be tweeked if they don&#039;t obtain Drop bombs could use a guiding program, always falling to the ground but slowly following the closest target. Otherwise with the speed of cars and the fact that you need to get above the target (most players spend their days more in the air than the ground, as stated before) this would be a waste.<br /><br />Floating mines, I think it would fit better if they were a minefield. 5 mini-mines eject out the back of your car with one use would allow them to spread over a larger area than just one big mine. The reason behind this is actually psychological; you would avoid at all costs a big floating ball that explodes, but a minefield is dangerous but possibly able to navigate if you need to. So, if you deploy a big mine behind you during an air chase the enemy&#039;s priority no. 1 would be to avoid that mine, but if it was a cloud of mines there is less intimidation and your pursuer might actually try to weave between the mini-mines. It wouldn&#039;t usually work, but it is possible, and that can be enough.<br />

The armor would have two main functions:<br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>The armor would absorb 50% of weapons damage, resulting in any weapons hitting the android would only deal half of their normal damage. Because an android is twice as vulnerable to weapons as a vehicle is, with this armor, weapons would have proportionally equal damage on an android, as an unarmored car (sorry if that is confusing).</li><li>This 50% of damage that is absorbed builds up a &quot;charge&quot; in the body armor. When the body armor is fully charged, it has the capacity to release an electrical discharge toward a vehicle or android within range. This electrical discharge would deal 6/10 damage to other entities in-game.</li></ul>Some proposed statistics:<br />Armor Statistics:<br />Protection*: 50%<br />Electrical Discharge Statistics:<br />Clip Size: 1<br />Fire Rate: Varies Depending on Energy Buildup<br />Accuracy: 9/10<br />Damage: 6/10<br />Area Damage: 1/10<br />Automatic**: Yes<br />Cost: 8,000 - 10,000 credits<br /><br /><br />*An android has half the health of a car. Because this armor absorbs 50% of weapons damage, a weapon would take away the same amount of a health bar as it would on an unarmored car. Let me provide an example to make it more clear:<br />If an unarmored car gets hit with a railgun, it loses 90% of its health bar. If an unarmored android gets hit with a railgun, it dies (because the android has half the health of a car). Now, if an android equipped with the Carbon Fibre Reactive Body Armor is hit with a railgun, it will only lose 90% of its health bar, just like an unarmored car.<br /><br />**The electricity would discharge toward a car automatically, whenever a car is within range. The player does not get to choose the time that the electricity discharges toward another car.<br /><br />Please tell me what you think of this idea. <img src="../../Smileys/akyhne/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /> <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s time for me to say it. What <span style="font-family: arial;" class="bbc_font"><span style="color: white;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-size: 0.7em;" class="bbc_size">the hell </span></span></span>are you thinking, making the android MORE powerful? Add the health of the car to the android PLUS an electrical secondary attack and they lose any disadvantages they had in combat with regular cars. An android with this armor would DOMINATE. Don&#039;t go with the &quot;We can make it more pricey&quot; option as well, we did that with the shotgun and people still complain, plus new players would be at a significant disadvantage for not being able to even rent it.

					Curse you computer! I&#039;ve been waiting on a new laptop for far too long now, much longer than I expected. Funny how I&#039;m no longer able to see ideas I suggest in-game. Rather sad, actually.<br /><br />Small idea I had for mines; how about a &quot;bouncing betty&quot; style system for most mines? It wouldn&#039;t change the range, but it would be able to pop up in the air and hit targets flying low to the ground. Most players spend most of their time in the air anyways, so they never really encounter mines making them almost certainly not going to hit. If we made mines easier to hit then they would be able to do more potential damage as there is a greater chance someone will hit them.

					I&#039;m going to say it; we need to sort out the current mines first. Truthfully though, I think they might as well be scrapped. The mini-bar mine isn&#039;t worth it&#039;s cost and it is one of the cheapest items in the game, the liberator is only useful when you have a guarantee enemies will travel along a section, and the rest of the mines are a mixed bag that are not only underpowered but also virtually all similar, with unbalanced costs. We need to differentiate the current mines, fix the costs, and make them more powerful in order for them to be a viable option compared to say the temp invincibility item (2:30 seconds of invincibility each round at lvl 20). If we were to use some of these ideas to spice up current mines, it could work.<br /><br />Remember that the isn&#039;t a lot displayed on the shop as well, so if you were to add new mines we would need to make their function simple enough to be explained in one sentence.

					The fact you got the heavy armor out so quickly is scary. That is extremely detailed, not only in the render but the actual surfaces. Modo must kick some serious tail.<br /><br />You know, I can&#039;t help but want to re-color this thing in all sorts of colors, just to see how it would look.

					I personally see no reason why the laser cannon should be a 1-hit KO against unarmored cars, yet lose practically all of it&#039;s power as soon as armor comes into play. It practically limits the weapon to a newb killing tool.<br /><br />The grenade launcher, I actually had an idea. How about the ability to detonate the grenade in-flight by pressing the fire button again? It would slow down the rate of fire, particularly at long range, but it would also make it effective against flying targets without sacrificing the core of a close range weapon.<br /><br />One last thing; how about we speed up the flame&#039;s travel speed? It is laughably short range yet you still seem to be unable to hit moving target without them literally running into the flames, and when you lead a target the fact that the range is in a small circle you decrease the range still since you can&#039;t get a straight, maximum distance shot of a target going parallel to you.
