If you were to use the radar only when it was equiped then it would be pretty useful but not overpowered since the weapon switch time would force you to use the radar in a safe location, usually away from enemies making it give only a general location of them (on the minimap a player off the radar would appear as a dot on the edge of the minimap, and the names wouldn&#039;t be precise enough for actual usage) and it would take up a weapon slot, a rather big disadvantage. It would also be a great weapon/item for team support since as long as you can communicate clearly you really only need one per team.<br /><br />If you still don&#039;t like the idea, I think there could be some less powerful item since the switch times are no longer in place as a counterbalance, such as (off the top of my head) flares that when activated pop a flare/firework from every enemy car, revealing invisible opponents but only for a few seconds.<br /><br />P.S. Where did you get that gun picture?

					EDIT: Originally there was an opinion on one of XD&#039;s ideas here, but apparently I put enough a good enough argument not only to get him to remove the post but to create one of the most guilt-provoking comments I have seen on the forum to date.

Most of us are content with posting threads for individual ideas, and it prevents us from getting off-topic (which I am showing you how it happens now, by players suggesting an idea that is different than the one currently under discussion and thus possibly shutting it out before it can be fully discussed). Plus it can get confusing on where to put your idea when it says to put it here while there is a designated folder for it already.

					Would this be a community project, or a one-man show? I think if it would be better as a community project since not only would we be able to keep each other interested in it longer but we would be able to divide up the work, assuming we have enough people interested in writing such a guide. Either way I would love to help doing math calculations to handle some of the stats to combine and simplify equipment and give them &quot;paper ratings&quot;, or ratings based on how they perform on paper but not necessarily in the game (for instance how good against armor, at distance, overall).<br /><br />Natty, while the wiki helps you have to realize that the wiki is pretty much designed specifically for facts, while a guide would be designed to increase skill. Sure you could learn a few things on the wiki but for all the essential strategies and tactics there really wouldn&#039;t be a place for it on the wiki. Plus, a guide would give a centralized location while the wiki&#039;s page hopping for information would be distracting to the goal of improving yourself as a player and it is quite possible the information is not edited and checked. Or Natty, you were just trying to take advantage of the situation to get traffic to the wiki, and I just wrote the above for no reason. Take your pick.

					<em>*Facepalm*</em><br /><br />All right, I see what is happening here. For the record, this should be in the FAQ, it really is frequently asked.<br /><br />To play with your Kongregate Log-in, create a new account on the Carbon Combat play page with the exact same name (punctuation and grammar counts) as your Kongregate account, but a different password. Once that account is created they should automatically synch, giving you the ability to purchase Premium Coins. They are premium and so cost REAL money but there are some third-party offers you can complete for free Premium Coins, but there is no fault on Carbon Combat if these offers do anything wrong (IE give away personal info) so be careful which ones you choose to complete.<br />

					Makes sense. For instance on the small maps I like to get a 3 on 3 going, and if you just want a certain number of players to join you are forced to the next highest option, causing for either you to just deal with it <del>or ban from the server in a rather unfair move</del> <em>(whoops, sorry, haven&#039;t actually played the game in forever)</em>. If we had more options then there are more possibilities, and it is also a nice way to test how big of a game your computer can handle.

					Now, I&#039;m going to say it: most of these suggestions are almost completely cosmetic. Why are they worth suggesting? Simply put, they give an appearance of something, most of which is &quot;that was cool&quot;. Let me start:<br />&nbsp;<ul class="bbc_list"><li><em>Screen shake</em>: Simple, anything that would shake the car (or would in real life) shakes the camera. It adds a bit of stun value and intensity to collisions and explosives. The camera shake would however never exceed a certain point so the player&#039;s screen is never obstructed.</li><li><em>Dive cone</em>: When moving downwards past a certain (high) speed a red cone of flames appears below it, like during space re-entry. Adds a bit of sci-fi and action to the game, and could simply be a slightly transparent cone with a red, possibly animated texture. Sorry I couldn&#039;t get a picture, surprisingly hard.</li><li><em>Drift</em>: Yes, drifting. An explanation for the near perfect turning, and could simply be the car tilting into the turn or a full gameplay feature with smokey tires and the works. Think I&#039;ll make that a poll.</li><li><em>Gun sounds</em>: Basically louder sounds for firing and delivering a weapon to a target. For instance, when firing a rocket a small click to signal the fuel being &quot;lit&quot;, a whoosh sound during flight and a satisfying <strong>BANG</strong> for the explosion. The perception of damage goes well with the perception of taking damage with screen shake too. Explosive canisters could get louder as well.</li></ul> Discuss.<br /><br />Edit: due to the drifting topic already been under/ is being under discussion, I removed the poll and encourage that if you wish to talk about the drifting idea it is limited to the link, or as part of a package involving more than one idea (or instance if you wish to rate each idea). I am also going to get a picture of the dive cone to add clarity in a few minutes.<br /><br />Edit: Here you go, first thing that popped up on Google. I might have to edit again to make sure I did this right, It&#039;s not coming up in preview.<br /><br />Edit, again: Apparently that didn&#039;t work, so let&#039;s try this:<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/A6jpU.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" border="0" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br /><br />There we go. The red flames are the &quot;dive cone&quot;.<br /><br />_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />So anyways, I would like to say that pretty much all of these ideas could come with a toggle on/off button for lower quality computers (with the exception of drifting, though if special effects such as smoke were added they could also be disabled by a button). So if you personally wouldn&#039;t use them due to a graphics card issue like I have but still want it then say so because it won&#039;t harm the game when they can be toggled.

					Here&#039;s an idea: let&#039;s get rid of Ideas and Suggestions.<br /><br />We already have a folder for it, so we can now do what we normally do and completely ignore this by making individual topics for ideas that are much less likely to go off-topic. This is an odd mess of trying to introduce new ideas while discussing old ones, which should be separated for clarity and to prevent idol conversation.

					I would like this game mode personally, since unlike capture the flag you don&#039;t go back to your base. So the team that is suffering heavy losses would be pushed back to their spawn point and forced to defend, which is unlike capture the flag in which when the enemy takes your flag you actually go on the offensive and try to kill the flag carrier, while the enemy falls back with the flag.<br /><br />There is however two changes I would like to be made to make the game mode more intense and more fun: <br /><br />Each team gets a turret to defend the generator. Why? So that a player can&#039;t just abandon his base under attack to attack the enemy&#039;s undefended base. The turret can be destroyed, but it is rather deadly when there is only one target so you would need to try and destroy it while you are attacking the enemy&#039;s base in a group. Once the turret is destroyed the base is much more vulnerable and it would take a big comeback to take victory, but the flock of enemies right at your spawn would hopefully provide enough cash potential for players to stay. Which reminds me: when the turret gets a kill the last player who damaged the killed player is credited with the kill so no one gets their kill stolen by the map.<br /><br />In the center of large maps, there is a KOTH style ring that when under control gives a new spawn point for the controlling team as well as a indestructible shield for their generator. Why? Because in giant maps you could easily reach the opponent&#039;s base, missing the other team on-route. If that were to happen it would create an awkward scenario where both teams are at the other team&#039;s base and the best course of action would be to try and destroy the generator right in front of you than travel all the way across the map and defend yours. I am thinking about you, Battle Island.

Right now, stop. I&#039;m calling you out right here, right now, because this is actually a pretty good overview of what happens everywhere on the forum.<br /><br />First off, lets go to cremyjr&#039;s post. Now if you can read through the complete lack of grammar (already in violation of forum etiquette) you&#039;ll see it really doesn&#039;t contribute to the discussion at <strong>ALL</strong>, and introduces a completely irrelevent topic you want discussed on an post that has <strong>NOTHING AT ALL</strong> to do with a suggestion that has <strong>ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED MULTIPLE TIMES</strong>. This was not only not worth posting, it should be given a <strong>PUNISHMENT</strong> to anyone who posts like this. Which leads to lamp&#039;s comment...<br /><br />Just how much constitutes a post from you, Lamp? You are not contributing at all the to conversation and just trying to get your post count up, and this shouldn&#039;t have been posted! You not only offer no content, but you actually try to de-rail the conversation! <strong>DO YOU THINK BEFORE YOU POST</strong>?<br /><br />Both of you, this is sad. When was the last time you saw a post from anyone other than Natty, me, U2M, XD or you two? Only six users! Maybe the other &quot;regulars&quot; check once a week, but now this forum isn&#039;t even worth posting when you check up on it for most people! This isn&#039;t a small incident, you guys are virtually single-handedly ruining this forum!<br /><br /><em>Edit: Reading over again an hour later, wow I must have been angry. But as much as I hate calling individuals out, there really needs to be some changes around here. For instance, I forget the last time I flagged a post (other than today) to moderation. Let me sign off quick, I don&#039;t like being too nice for too long before I snap.</em>

					I truthfully think the ranking system could use a bit more. For instance, hidden requirements such as time spent browsing, minimum karma and post count. <strong>HIDDEN</strong>, so we don&#039;t get people trying to post every ten seconds, leaving their computer on all night and begging for positive karma.<br /><br />Just though this would be an appropriate place to start a conversation.<br /><br />I approve of this.&nbsp; <br />-Nattyfrank

					Resolved/Hidden would be great. I was actually looking on this forum and was thinking about using it to store a draft with pictures and decent, easy-to-use organization for a game I probably could never and would never make (though it&#039;s nice to dream) and was disappointed when I found I couldn&#039;t make a hidden post. If that would be misuse of the forum then a mod could take it down, but hey, I still say we need a resolved/hidden option. Imagine if we were able to resolve those topics people comment on just because other people are commenting on. We could shift our focus to new ideas, problems, ect. and get more out of this forum.

					Yeah, they suck, but at least they can do a basic deathmatch. When you go single player you no longer need to worry about the game being &quot;fair&quot; to all sides, since the bots don&#039;t really care if they are fair or not. So an endless bot survival minigame for the IOS/android that gives some credits you can use online might be an option, or lopsided matches against the player equipment-wise (maybe even adding stat boosts not available to regular players, like a passive, non-degrating 25% armor boost) can be options.<br /><br />In fact, this single player idea might as well also be the campaign many players call for. A mobile, basic single player CC game and the multiplayer computer game with linkable accounts. 2 birds, 1 stone?<br />

					And that game is abandoned by it&#039;s creator and uses Adobe Flash, a much easier game engine to hack due to it&#039;s popularity.

					Decent argument Lamp.<br /><br />Pro tip: When you got all defensive saying you can&#039;t take it down anyways, it seemed as if you WANTED to be taken down. If we take down the CC side, we don&#039;t need to care about the Mars side, simple. The fact that this forum uses different log-ins also means that while we can&#039;t ban you from your club forum on Plexpedia, we can ban you from CC, thus severing the club from the CC side. So don&#039;t taunt, it usually doesn&#039;t help.
