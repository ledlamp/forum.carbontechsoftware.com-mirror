					LOL, donations? I&#039;m going to be blunt: this job would likely be below minimum wage for an independent artist. CT can&#039;t support himself on the game right now, let alone 2 or 3 people. You would need a good stream of ad revenue from frequent plays and premium content buyers, which is a sharp minority in the free internet gaming world.<br /><br /><br />HOWEVER, we could go for community content to support the need for updates. Maps are one thing we currently have a basic form of, but we could improve on it with features like a more user friendly map editor, a better rating system and more gameplay placeable items such as flags and multiple spawn points. We could also see about starting up a map making team (likely when we have more members for I doubt anyone has the skills now).

					I don&#039;t know what you mean by see people fighting with this on. I think the problem is that if someone is wearing the armor, then someone can just fly away and avoid the player until they die. The armor to me seems to be more of a punishment than a gain.<br /><br /><br />Perhaps just have damage in a radius around the car, and just that?

					The reason I think this would be OP is for one of the same reasons the shotgun is OP: the spread actually helps at medium to long distances. You don&#039;t need a perfect shot, you just need to aim in the general direction to score some damage.<br /><br /><br />To help explain, think of the minigun: at medium to long range you don&#039;t score any hits simply because the bullets have no spread, forcing you to place the cursor leading the target which isn&#039;t an exact science and so results in misses, even if you are skilled with the minigun. With spread, you aim near the target and bullets fly in an area, which would include the area that you would need to aim to score a hit when leading a target.

					So you don&#039;t like the idea of the nuke missiles because their OP, but you think the idea of the black spots would be too much? You, my friend, didn&#039;t read correctly.<br /><br /><br />The black spots (NOT blood spots, to keep violence down) apply whenever a nuke fired by YOU detonates, and affects YOU and only YOU. It does NOT affect people in the killzone.<br /><br /><br />And for the record, price doesn&#039;t make a weapon OP or not, just look at the shotgun.<br /><br /><br />I would go into more detail but you seem to not be reading my posts with an biased view coming into this, so I&#039;m not wasting any more time.

					...I need to stop you right there before this becomes a flat-out rant thread on all of CC problems. This isn&#039;t a problem with the game, it&#039;s a problem with how it&#039;s presented. I doubt a new player is going to freak out at a rental system when it doesn&#039;t hurt them in any way, or premium credits when premium items are commonplace in multiplayer games. Things like new weapons we have done before and it hasn&#039;t affected our ratio of keeping players to players coming in. <br /><br /><br />We could have the greatest game in the world, but if no one knows about it it doesn&#039;t matter. We could have the greatest game in the world, but if no one can figure out how to play it it doesn&#039;t matter.

					I&#039;m thinking something around 4000 credits, somewhat expensive so players gravitate toward other weapons first but not too expensive that only pros get it. One thing I considered with the weapon was the fact that it cuts through armor like butter. It would be the closest thing to an equalizer on the battlefield, with a person with a nuke being equal in terms of firepower no matter the enemy. It shouldn&#039;t be handed out too cheaply though: if EVERYONE gets a nuke as a first gun they buy the game wouldn&#039;t be as fun. As shown above a nuke sounds super powerful and would attract a lot of people, particularly in this game with some pretty sturdy cars.<br /><br /><br />One thing I never commented on: the blueprints to that gun Director posted say Ion Cannon Destroyer.

					The question is though, can we keep them? We get a lot of people who visit the game and never come back, and no matter what you are doing that isn&#039;t a good thing. We need loyalty, a reason to come back, and to make a good first impression. That combined with getting more players to play will help re-populate CC.

					<br />That looks like a Kawasaki, am I right? Sorry, don&#039;t know much about bikes. Anyways I like the idea. I just had a problem with this:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="../../feedback-ideas/bikes/msg3224/index.html#msg3224">Quote from: cremyjr on <span title=" 24, 2012, 09:47:33 am" style="cursor:default">Late November, 2012</span></a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">well there was already a post for this, the hoverbike (or whatever it was called).<br />anyway, dude, how can&nbsp; a vehicle have a certain amount of health?! the health depends on whether or not you have armour, and also what kind of armour it is. why does liftoff have to be so different? why cant we make it like the car, theres no difference between they&#039;re wheels. also, if it will have top speed AND accel, maybe even handling? why dont we make it that it cant fly? with all the other attributes it can launch up mountains 80 degrees steep or less going at least 50 mph. maybe you can even move in air like a dirtbike! you can press WASD to rotate at flip. while pressing space you can also barrel roll. i dont see how thats possible, all the weapons have the same scope, and the cars can aim forward too.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Let&#039;s break it down one by one, because half of it is just nonsense.<br /><br /><br /><em>anyway, dude, how can&nbsp; a vehicle have a certain amount of health?! the health depends on whether or not you have armour</em><br /><br /><br />All right, I&#039;m going to stop you there. Let me remind you something: OUR CARS HAVE HEALTH, REMEMBER? That was what he was referring to. The health bar would be 3/4s that of the car, or 25% more vulnerable to damage. If you are still confused, then think of it like this: the android has 1/2 of the health of a car.<br /><br /><br /><em>why does liftoff have to be so different? why cant we make it like the car, theres no difference between they&#039;re wheels</em><br /><br /><br />It&#039;s simple: the bike would be a more physics based vehicle. Things like instead of turning left you lean left, turning the wheels to the left instead of just turning the wheels left would create a more accurate bike riding experience. The same would be for the air: instead of the body of the car moving, the wheels would move pushing the body and possibly rotating and flipping it if you can&#039;t control it. For the record though, this was a good question.<br /><br /><br /><em>if it will have top speed AND accel, maybe even handling? why dont we make it that it cant fly? with all the other attributes it can launch up mountains 80 degrees steep or less going at least 50 mph</em><br /><br /><br />As said by answering you previous question, it would NOT have maximum handling. It would be a smaller and faster target but it wouldn&#039;t be say android level on avoiding gunfire; it still is propelled by wheels and wheels need to turn for a bit before it gets to top speed, plus the vise-versa of a complete stop taking longer. When flying it would move faster but still be an easy target for snipers and missile launchers, even more so that evasive maneuvers such as flips are much harder to pull off.<br /><br /><br /><em>maybe you can even move in air like a dirtbike! you can press WASD to rotate at flip. while pressing space you can also barrel roll</em><br /><br /><br />If you can give me one practical use for this I would fully agree, but it just wouldn&#039;t have a use. Plus the space bar scopes, remember?<br /><br /><br /><em>i dont see how thats possible, all the weapons have the same scope, and the cars can aim forward too.</em><br /><br /><br />I&#039;m going to take a shot in the dark and say you are referring to the turret being on the front of the bike. What that means is that you can aim forward DOWN as well as straight forward. The car would need to be lower than the target in order to shoot at them, at least forwards. The bike would not have this problem, though with 3/4s health it would less suited for sitting still and firing away due to return fire taking out the bike first. It would have to be limited to a run &amp; gun style.<br /><br /><br />Let me ask YOU a question: do you like the idea of the bike? I couldn&#039;t figure it out from your post.

					You have to realize how much a car is in contact with other cars. You don&#039;t actually do a lot of damage in a short period of time. I&#039;m not just referring to Battle Island with the travel distance between bases, I&#039;m talking about car duels taking a good 30 seconds, maybe more.

The nukes I have suggested are a devastating weapon, but it comes with consequences. Imagine someone with a nuke, and someone with a plasma blaster. In addition to it&#039;s ease to avoid (due to being a slow rocket, going about the same speed as a rocket launcher rocket) it only has one shot, and if that shot misses due to say the plasma blaster car shaking the aim of the other car, the car with the nuke is completely vulnerable for a huge amount of time with no kills to show for it. If it hits, then they get the kill, but they still are vulnerable, not to mention partially blinded. Say a person is super efficient with the nuke and get not one but TWO kills every time, plus never dies, then they can get in a ten minute round a maximum of twelve kills, tops. Now compare that to your best kills stat with other weapons; significantly lower, no?<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m going to also back this up with another fact: if you get say 10% of your screen covered in black each time you use the nuke, you have taken up half of your view by the time you finish the game, leaving you less effective in combat as you use more nukes. I was thinking the spots would cover about 15% of the screen each time you fire a nuke, so with three nukes fired you have covered a little under half your screen, and with six you are completely blind. Remember that these don&#039;t go away when you respawn, so firing a nuke is a decision you REALLY want to be sure of before you set one off. It would be limited to a role as a panic gun, a tool exclusively designed to counter high-end players or by people who just like nukes and would suffer the consequences, making them easy pickings for other players after they fire off a few.<br /><br /><br />If anyone wants to present any reason why it would be overpowered, please do. I&#039;m tired of just people saying &quot;it&#039;s OP&quot; and that being the end of it.

Right now my friends are completely limited to forum members but perhaps that could be changed to include more people.<br /><br /><br />There is also one more community I completely forgot to talk about: Mars Explorer. I know there&#039;s been some history but ironically with CT gone we just might be able to get a few players from there if we mingle a bit.<br /><br /><br />So in short, the three things <strong>we</strong> (as in hopefully not just me) can do:<br /><ul class="bbc_list" style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>Go around Kongregate.</li><li>Be more social with players playing CC.</li><li>Play on Mars Explorer.</li></ul>Anyone willing to help out?

					I want you to look at how many people are online now, excluding bots. At best it hovers around 20 people, at worst 5. It doesn&#039;t take a genius to realize we don&#039;t appeal as much as other multiplayer games do. We don&#039;t have a big studio backing us or a energy system to do it. Some ideas I&#039;ve come up with are below, if anyone has any others please post.<br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Community outreach. This is the big one; we have said we are open to new members of the community but we haven&#039;t done a good job of showing it. Since it&#039;s the only major portal to host Unity3D I&#039;m mostly talking about Kongregate here, which we don&#039;t do a lot of good attracting the community. I can think of several reasons, including not keeping an update log off the forum, virtually no feedback on comments and a not very active developer account around the site (even before CT went AWOL). If people like our game they will stay with us and while content helps appearances matter too.</li><li>Controls. A newb has a horrible time controlling his car, as you have likely seen. The physics-based flying is fun but easily gets out of hand, driving has insane oversteer and weapons are hard to aim on the move. We can keep the controls but we need to make things like /flylock and hovering more noticeable, as well as add things like soft steering and aiming assist.</li><li>Staff. If we are to stand out from the pack we need to keep a friendly appearance, and staff (or more likely an active moderator crew) are critical. Now we can&#039;t dictate people&#039;s personal lives and I don&#039;t expect most moderators to come back but we can at least nominate a few more people. I was thinking of announcing that we are looking for moderators and seeing who comes knocking. It&#039;s pretty easy to tell who would make a decent moderator from a message, or at least who isn&#039;t.</li></ul>

					1. It isn&#039;t, does that matter?. If that was the ONE thing that would protect you from this it wouldn&#039;t be fair, making the temporary invincibility OP, making all other items less useful.<br /><br /><br />2. Um, I never said how large. Compared to all other items very large would be about the size of, say the upper platform of the Chokepoint base (including the minor damage area).<br /><br /><br />3. There are several flaws in your argument. First off is the reload time: you would only buy yourself one clearing of the base before being locked in for a reload, which you can&#039;t do with the flag. So if it takes 30 seconds to go to the base and take the flag, then (assuming you get the flag in perfect stride without dying) you need to take three flags before you get another nuke to launch, and remember you can&#039;t switch weapons while reloading. Second is the respawn time: if you were to &quot;snipe&quot; with the nuke then everyone would respawn by the time you get to the base, or if you fire as you come near the base you either run the risk of killing yourself or leaving yourself defenseless when everyone respawns, which remember only takes about 5 seconds. Third is the fact that it only clears near the flag and not everyone who has a line of sight on the flag or is ready to ambush you as soon ass you take the flag, for instance someone waiting at the top of the bunker in Abandoned Silos or someone on the glass bridges in Chokepoint. For sniping, remember that there would need to be something behind the target for the nuke to detonate and the target to be moving slowly enough for you to hit it with the slow moving rocket, limiting it&#039;s effectiveness at longer ranges, but remember that using it in close range is even worse for you could kill yourself, making sniping pretty much the only way to use the nuke. And remember that if you miss the minor damage isn&#039;t guaranteed since the target has to be in the minor damage area and even if they are that&#039;s a small gain for a minute and a half defenseless and decreased visibility.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m going to say it: you seem to have looked at the idea and said &quot;I don&#039;t like it&quot; before you understood it.

					Now, this is simply a devastating gun with a painful consequence for using. Anything that&#039;s in the very large area of effect just dies, period, no matter what (even temporary invincibility, so as not the make it more preferable to the shield with this weapon implemented). There is also minor damage and lots of pushback for people just outside the area of effect. However, it has a one shot clip with a minute thirty seconds reload time and causes a few black dots to appear on the user&#039;s screen on detonation, potentially blinding or at least lowering visibility if the nuke is used repeatedly. There is also the fact it only moves as fast as the regular rocket launcher with no tracking, so it is possible for someone to miss and be locked in for a minute thirty with no weapon.<br /><br /><br />Thoughts? OP?

					Lol lamp, it&#039;s a glitch.<br /><br /><br />When you go as far under the base as you can and exit your car you can sometimes go inside the object. You and me both know about how faces are only one sided, so someone inside an object can shoot out as much as they want but no one can shoot in.
