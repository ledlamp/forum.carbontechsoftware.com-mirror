					So you may know I haven&#039;t been posting due dates. Well for the time being I will be writing without them, to keep the pressure off and improve writing quality. I have a grand master plan, you should know.<br /><br /><br />Step 1: Finish episode 9. This will be a LONG episode, but it will introduce a lot of characters around base. If anyone wants a guest star role, sign up now.<br /><br /><br />Step 2: Kill someone in episode 10. Teehee! Also I will get to the mission I foreshadowed way back when I started the fan-fic.<br /><br /><br />Step 3: Combine all episodes into a season 1 directory readable in several formats, with edits to all episodes to cover plot holes or bad bits of writing.<br /><br /><br />Step 4: Take a break for a bit. Then devise a new plan.

					This would require a total re-vamp of lighting for all standard CC maps. But if this does happen, we can expand on it even more with less effort. Screw the standard skybox, let&#039;s get Unity3D to do the work of lighting for us.

					Friendly fire is not actually very friendly. It is shooting your teammates, basically. Disabling friendly fire lets you shoot your team as much as you like and deal no damage.<br /><br /><br />I like the options personally.

					One thing I would like to add is that to add some weather effects you may make the file size of the game much larger.<br /><br /><br />This is due to lighting being set with the world in Unity. For instance to reduce file size instead of adding entire new worlds with different lighting for each time of day, there is just one world with the same lighting. You can tell by looking at the shadows: they don&#039;t change as the skybox changes.<br /><br /><br />So unless there is something I am missing, then adjusting lighting may need an entire new world, drastically increasing file size.

					I&#039;m going to restate the weather ideas to keep myself organized.<br /><br /><br />1. Night becomes pitch black, with NV camera (dunno what the NV toggles mean, clarify)?<br />2. Custom fog option with ability to set density, height and size.<br />3. The midday option&#039;s sun would become brighter, enough to at least partially blind someone driving into the sun.<br /><br /><br />Now my responces!<br /><br /><br />1. I do think night time could be darker but not enough that it requires night vision to see. It would be rather pointless to add NV, for it wouldn&#039;t do anything compared to normal vision in light.<br />2. A fog option would be good, but the sliders just seem like they don&#039;t do enough. Do we really need to be able to set how dense the fog? What good would a height option do to affect the game? I don&#039;t know why you would want to touch a size slider unless you want to cover a specific area of the map, which could be used to harm one specific team.<br />3. Trust me, it will get annoying VERY quickly. You&#039;ll regret your own idea if this is put in.

First off, I&#039;m not really a fan of the 12 kills thing because who gets 12 kills in a row? You&#039;re lucky to get 12 kills in a match, let alone without dying. <br /><br /><br />Now with the turrets both being awarded at the same time, we are going to have to pick the best one. I prefer the first one, which I see as just a rocket launcher turret. The whole movement thing seems too complex and so I suggest it fires automatically OR you manually control it.<br /><br /><br />For your kill streak rewards, I like it. It would need a meter on the HUD to track it and maybe a little explanation&nbsp; when you get your first kill (kill stronger enemies to get kill streaks faster! is all that is needed).

					Some things I would like to add: <br /><br /><br />Since you can carry two weapons on the car, in order for this system to work you would need to be able to have two weapons as an android.<br /><br /><br />This could be a way of potentially balancing OP weapons. For instance the vehicle&#039;s shotgun could be weak, while the android&#039;s shotgun would suck.<br /><br /><br />There would also be the need for an anti-vehicle weapon (lots of damage) and an anti-infantry weapon (able to hit other androids), if you want to be able to defend yourself from all fronts as an android. Thankfully newbs have a plasma rifle and a rocket launcher to start off with.<br /><br /><br />Oh and I&#039;m also editing some weapon propositions for balancing.

					Obviously these would all be handheld versions and would generally have less power. What I suggest is taking the base weapon and reducing stats. I listed changes below compared to a level 1 car weapon:<br /><br />Rocket Launcher: Two shot clip (Note that weapons would not have infinite ammo, though a reload animation would be nice it wouldn&#039;t be nessesary)<br />Plasma Rifle: Half the fire rate, bullet spread similar to Assault Rifle<br />Grenade Launcher: One shot clip, no charging grenades<br />EMP Grenade Launcher: One shot clip, no charging grenades<br />Homing Rocket Launcher: One shot clip<br />Flamethrower: Half damage, clip of 50<br />Assault Rifle: 20 shot clip with reload time of minigun, small increase in damage from current Assault Rifle (about 20%)<br />Sniper: Quarter damage, half reload time<br />Laser Sniper: 3/4s damage<br />Hook Launcher: Slightly shorter rope, increasing the chance of being rammed by the car the rope is attached to.<br />Shotgun: Half clip, half amount of pellets (lowers potential damage and the chance of a long range shot hitting), 3/4s damage<br /><br />Anyone see a problem with these weapons?<br /><br /><br />Some of these weapons have been edited due to them not being balanced with each other. If a weapon seems overpowered (like the Laser Sniper), look at it a bit more closely. For instance with the Laser Sniper with 3/4s damage it can only take a car out in two, maybe even three hits, but there&#039;s the painfully long reload between shots that gives the car lots of time to fight back. Same for underpowered weapons: the shotgun for instance is a very good android killer.

					Let me bring up the suggestion of android weapons I said and compare it to your wants.<br /><br /><br />Sniper rifles: Laser Sniper (Laser Cannon) and a regular Sniper (Railgun).<br />Machine guns: Plasma Rifle (Plasma Blaster) and Assault Rifle (Minigun).<br />Grenade launchers: Grenade Launcher (Grenade Launcher), EMP Grenade Launcher (EMP Grenade Launcher) and Hook Launcher (Grappling Hook)<br />Rocket Launchers: Rocket Launcher (Rocket Launcher) and Homing Rocker Launcher (Missile Launcher).<br /><br /><br />So we already have two in each category if we use android weapons as mini car weapons. Plus there would be a shotgun and flamethrower, two weapons that can be miniaturized. Then as we add more car weapons we also get more android weapons, a win-win.<br /><br /><br />The only problem is rather simple: It would take more time to implement weapons, not to mention doing all the weapons we have now at the same time could take a while. Development doesn&#039;t come instantly, especially in small games like these that have only one guy in the credits (CarbonTech would be that guy).

					Welcome to the forum.<br /><br /><br />First idea, I kinda like it, though perhaps you can&#039;t bail out again (that would let you keep on bailing out over and over again).<br /><br /><br />Second, that can be hard. The most popular suggestion would be for your car&#039;s gun to have a miniature gun with similar function for the android. For instance the rocket launcher would give your android a rocket launcher, or the railgun would give the android a sniper.<br /><br /><br />We call the person the android BTW.

					All right, nicely said. My only problem is with 1 and 2.<br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t see how team auto-balance is related, really. The question is that if there is just one guy transporting a prisoner in a big metal cage, he is an extremely easy target and is all alone. I just think that&#039;s unfair.<br /><br /><br />Let&#039;s say it&#039;s a 6 player game, and you successfully transport the cash safe. So, 2500/3=833.3 repeating, which means you have gone over the credit cap already. A twelve player game would give half that (about 415), half of the credit cap and about 5 kills of non-newb players. My average credits per game is around 200, so with just one safe transport no matter the amount of players (since 24 is the max) I&#039;ve reached my average.<br /><br /><br />Also, you owe how this would work for the soldier.

					1. Why did you start with a 1 if that was the only part of your list?<br />2. Let&#039;s do some math. A player can only cover one approach since they can only aim in one direction less they do not aim and lose more accuracy letting some players slip through. Now, if there are 4 or so ways to approach from, then a player can only cover 25% of the approach angles, letting 75% into the clubhouse (though the player could then use the 5 second period required inside to kill players, putting it below 75% of players let through). So for every player, they can cover only ONE approach angle.<br />3. Well there&#039;s a minimap, duh. That doesn&#039;t change the fact that someone can only cover one angle successfully, since they can&#039;t aim in two directions. And remember, invisibility would still help tremdously; you would be a harder target to see physically, a player would be able to go in fast enough before the minimap marks his position, and it would take some time to focus on the invisible player letting other players slip through. Also, not everyone is a pro.<br />4.Who ever said bots would be in the game type? They&#039;re worse enough in CTF. Besides, a bot fires directly at you and never leads the target so if you don&#039;t go in a straight line you would be able to get in easy.<br /><br /><br />Look, I know one hit kill sounds intimidating, but it&#039;s not that bad. You can only do so much with a weapon even if it&#039;s one hit kill.

The thing is it&#039;s situational, not generic to all clubhouses. Since a weapon isn&#039;t 100% accurate or likely even 10% accurate at long range, players can close in, then it&#039;s up to them to think smart and devise a strategy in how to get in the clubhouse.<br /><br /><br />Need more convincing? Don&#039;t forget about bullet travel time, limited clips, the fact that players can&#039;t aim in more than one direction at a time, the skill factor (not everyone is as skilled as you), terrain blocking view, invisibility powerups, multiple players teaming up to enter the clubhouse at different angles, the ability to use explosives to shake the aim of club members, and the fact that the only players traveling to the clubhouse in a straight line are idiots.<br /><br /><br />Also, players get credits for kills of the other team as well as objectives, in this case they gain credits for each bonus point. So you can earn credits, and fairly for your accomplishments.

					Let me stop you at the first sentence. I came up the idea, so if you are going to rail someone rail me.<br /><br /><br />Second, do you think we would spawn everyone on top of each other? That would be stupid with one hit kill weapons. The starting club member would spawn in the clubhouse, and everyone who joins the club would stay in the club, away from the normal player&#039;s spawn.<br /><br /><br />Third, as unbelievable as it may sound, weapons aren&#039;t that accurate.

					All right, so here&#039;s the jist of it: Players try to enter a designated area defended by an invincible and super deadly car, at which point they join &quot;the club&quot; and become invincible and try to prevent other players from earning points.<br /><br /><br />More details: One player chosen at random starts out as a &quot;club member&quot;, who becomes invincible and gets a one-hit kill minigun. The rest of the players start out in normal gear. Players try to enter a certain area of the map known as the &quot;clubhouse&quot;, which is just an area really marked by transparent semi-sphere of light around and above the area. The club members get a point for each of their own kills, plus extra points at the end of the round for how many players are not club members. Normal players gain points by entering and staying in the clubhouse for 5 seconds, at which point they earn a bonus equal to the amount of players in the game minus the amount of club members and become a club member themselves. So the quicker you get to the clubhouse the more points you earn, and the better you defend the clubhouse the more points you earn. Friendly fire is locked ON, so normal players can kill each other if they feel that it would prevent them from getting to the hill. Rounds end after a set amount of time or when only one player is left out of the club. Club members also cannot leave the clubhouse, so they don&#039;t just go after kills and abandon their objective. You can bail out of your car and the same rules apply, with club members still being invincible and still killing in one shot. The winner is the player with the most points after 3 rounds.<br /><br /><br />Now, with a one-hit kill minigun the club members rain death to pretty much anyone they see. So the only way to reach the hill is by sneaking in, pulling off some awesome evasive maneuvers or going en mass with other players. It will only get harder to get in the club as the club gets bigger, so getting there first is key. At the same time, you will be battling other players to enter the club, so going lightweight with your equipment might not be the best strategy.<br /><br /><br />If a one-hit kill minigun is too powerful, then downgrading to a one-hit kill plasma blaster and if needed down to a quick-reload sniper or one-hit-kill missile launcher would solve the problem.<br /><br /><br />Possible clubhouse locations:<br /><br /><br />Battle Island: The bases, the abandoned bases, at the crashed spaceship sniper spawn area<br />Unity Island: The lake, the top of the highest mountain (the one with the invisibility powerup on it&#039;s peak)<br />Abandoned Silos: Between the two bunkers<br />Chokepoint: The bases, at the minigun spawns, the center platform<br />Sanctum: Center platform, platforms with two buildings, satalite dishes

					Yes, that&#039;s a pothole. I just made a bunch of circles inside themselves to make a &quot;bowl&quot;. If the map is too big then the pothole will not work, so keep the model small enough that the pothole works.<br /><br /><br />Some other clarification:<br /><br /><br />I made this for CarbonFest, so I put in a viewing area for spectators over by where it says Carbon Combat. You swerve into the other lane and back again to avoid it, doubling it as an obstacle.<br /><br /><br />This was actually made on a tileset of highway pieces which were loaded in then put into the model. For instance, there are four types of curves, each type being the same to all others of it&#039;s type. You can see the &quot;grid&quot; pattern with each tile piece having a support pillar in it&#039;s center (with the exception of the curves).<br /><br /><br />I epicly failed on the turns. I basically drew a circle, then cut it into fourths and used that as a turn. But it went wrong somehow, glitching/reversing faces on each turn plus making the yellow median go off-center in some areas.<br /><br /><br />The model&#039;s in public domain right now. If you can fix it, it&#039;s yours...but it would be nice if someone posted a fixed version here.
