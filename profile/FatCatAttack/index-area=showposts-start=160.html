					Post answers your question on shotguns and I try to figure out what type of shotgun CC uses so I don&#039;t waste space.<br /><br />Double-Barrel shotgun: Two barrels are loaded with a single shell. When you pull a trigger (there are two triggers) you fire one barrel, you pull the other trigger you fire the other barrel. However to reload you &quot;break&quot; open the shotgun by by bending the barrel forward, assuming nothing has gone horribly wrong the barrels with fold forward, allowing you to put new shells in. This method does not let you use more than two shells in your gun, but you have to realize this version is an old style; while there still are some around today (mostly recreational purposes) they were mainly used in the late 1800s and are now obsolete.<br /><br />Pump-Action shotgun: A reliable modern shotgun version that you put a clip of shells into. When you &quot;pump&quot; the pump, a spring loads the next shell into the gun. It could possibly be the version CC uses, but I don&#039;t see a pump on the barrel.<br /><br />Semi-Automatic shotgun: When you fire, the gun also &quot;pumps&quot; for you, which is cool. It could be the version CC uses, but the fire rate is well not semi-automatic.<br />&nbsp;

					<span style="font-size: 1.35em;" class="bbc_size">Let me start this off with an announcement: I&#039;m back!</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">Yup, I now have access to a laptop that can run CC properly. Well, the keyboard is broken in an odd way (It types but the alphabet and number keys doesn&#039;t work in games so I have to custom map the controls to exclude the alphabet and number keys, which leaves me with my right hand on the arrow keys and using CTRL to fly, with a trackpad at my left hand and an on-screen keyboard at the bottom of the screen used for flipping my car and going on foot. Try it, it doesn&#039;t help) but it does run CC so I am able to play. If anyone needs training...go somewhere else, I&#039;m not good. I need training, someone please help me.<br /><br /></span><span style="font-size: 1.45em;" class="bbc_size">So anyways...<br /></span><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size"><br />As a new player in terms of equipment and car control I saw a different side of CC today. And it sucks bad. Let me go over the full list of problems: (note that below &quot;pro&quot; refers to players with a full set of fully upgraded equipment and average skill)<br /></span><ul class="bbc_list"><li><span style="font-size: 1.35em;" class="bbc_size">Completely incapable of competing with those who own armor &amp; weapons.</span><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">Any player</span><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size"> with the simplest understanding of the game could destroy any pro in newb gear when</span> they are decked out with fully upgrade weapons &amp; armor. Even if I manage to make a dent in a player&#039;s health, there is always a health powerup (which does so much more for their health bar than mine) or even worse, ninja regenerating armor. Of course this scenario never happens in survival mode, but no one plays it since non-CTF maps for some reason can&#039;t host it and bots never host survival games.</li><li><span style="font-size: 1.35em;" class="bbc_size">High equipment prices. </span><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">If I played an hour a day in standard 10 minute back-to-back rounds, I would be able to at best make the credit cap (already a rather optimistic estimate) of 700 for 6 matches</span>, for 4200 credits a day. It takes about 40000 to buy and fully upgrade a shotgun &amp; sniper rifle, 15000 for a vehicle, about 18500 to buy and fully upgrade ninja regenerating armor, and about 17000 to buy and fully upgrade a temporary shield, that&#039;s a total of 90500 credits to fully deck out your equipment to pro level. Now divide that by 4200 credits an hour, and it takes you a little over 21.5 hours to deck out your equipment, not including the fact that you don&#039;t always make the credit cap and that several pro players have back-up equipment in case their loadout isn&#039;t working. 21 and a half hours of slugging through the newb and mid-level ranks. We simply don&#039;t have enough content for anyone to spend that amount of time playing this game. Don&#039;t get me started on how long it would take you to buy out the shop.</li><li><span style="font-size: 1.35em;" class="bbc_size">Lack of balance with equipment. </span><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">I&#039;m pretty sure we could track when the last flamethrower kill was in years. There is also the factor of the shotgun which is hard to obtain for newbs </span>is a complete domination weapon which makes the rest of the weapons obsolete. There is also the factor of mines being completely useless and only being a cash trap for inexperienced of curious players, and the fact that armor offers no noticeable movement penalty making heavier and more exotic armors better than light armor in every way.</li><li><span style="font-size: 1.35em;" class="bbc_size">And of course, the n00b tactics.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">Despite </span>our best attempts, there is still a good deal of ways to piss off a better opponent. The most obvious is /respawn to prevent them from gaining a kill and credits they deserve; it hurts their team, but a true n00b doesn&#039;t care about that. The shotgun has given way to the new way to spray &amp; pray over long distances, doing considerable damage. Matches between two decked-out players now comes down to jousting matches with the shotgun, eliminating most if not all pro tactics of before.</li></ul><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">I realize that these are problems we have accepted in the community, which makes it even worse. There is no movement to try and balance the game out, and if anything there is movement against just that with new and more powerful equipment coming out at higher prices (the shock armor to help snipers counteract the tactic of shaking their aim making them more dominant, the new vehicles which offer significant movement advantages over standard cars and most obvious the shotgun are some more recent examples). I have some ideas that could help the newb at least go 1.0 KD if they are skillful enough, but I know not all of them are popular (the last two ones). So let me start off with some simpler, more agreeable ideas:</span><ul class="bbc_list"><li><span style="font-size: 1.35em;" class="bbc_size">Equipment needs to be balanced. </span>What comes to mind as the standard OP weapon is the shotgun. The rest of the equipment is debatable and so I won&#039;t mention it, but come on, have you seen the amount of players using the shotgun? Ever wonder why?</li><li><span style="font-size: 1.35em;" class="bbc_size">Survival mode is available on all maps and is a possible game type bots play in.</span> Survival has become unpopular with pro players since they lose their equipment advantage, so they never host it themselves. It evens the battleground of a survival match a bit, but the fact is there are none. We need to give new players the option of playing survival mode instead of hosting a survival match and waiting around for half an hour before quitting.</li><li><span style="font-size: 1.35em;" class="bbc_size">Equipment needs to be cheaper. </span><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">I&#039;m not saying make it so you can buy out the shop in an hour, but </span>the rate at which you can buy equipment now is ridiculous. Item prices need to go down, especially for the more powerful weapons.</li><li><span style="font-size: 1.35em;" class="bbc_size">Upgrades need to go. </span><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">Yes, let&#039;s get rid of upgrades, make everything start at level 20 when you buy it. It is such an obvious system of players with more money being more powerful than players with less money, even if they rent out equipment.</span></li></ul>Well, that&#039;s about it. I might add a poll later if something comes up in a debate, but I got what I wanted said out there.

					I wanted to make a poll, you see. But I needed a final result before a certain date, you see. But, when I put in a close poll date it did nothing, you see. The poll system is glitched, and I&#039;m surprised it works as well as it does. Some options do nothing, others make things worse (poll closes yesterday). Anyone else notice this when making polls or is it just me?

					This wouldn&#039;t be that bad of a download game for a console (Wii Shop, PlayStation Store, Xbox Arcade) but there are a few issues:<br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>The game is Unity. I don&#039;t know if all consoles support Unity3D or what version they support, but you can&#039;t expect it to be a universal game.</li><li>Most downloads have a maximum size. This would limit some features or require extra time for updates as CT would need to keep the game under a certain size.</li><li>Servers. If our servers work, then we would likely need to expand them.</li></ul>Of course, there are some benifits:<ul class="bbc_list"><li>Money. Online ad revenue is nothing compared to what we could accomplish on the download market. Plus the game is indie, so bonus points for those wanting to support that.</li><li>Popularity. Most of the people who play a good amount online generally are not part of the console community. We get the name out, plus with an easy and universally trusted download.</li><li>Performance. No more frame rate reduction for you slow computer types. We could also run better graphics.</li></ul>I&#039;m guessing I am a general opinion here so I am just going to state it: if CT wants to port it to consoles, great, I&#039;m with him 100%. If not, then I realize the problems and I&#039;m with him 100%.<br /><br />P.S. Just so you know, I used to have an Xbox but then after a few years the disc tray stopped opening. We were able to open it by hitting the side of the Xbox with our palm, but apparently that wasn&#039;t a good idea.

					I remember, there was this once incident back on the old forum where a certain martian leaked information about CT&#039;s activities. I forget the name, but it was a significant event and (almost) resulted in a angry mob before CT could clarify his actions. I have a certain phobia of visiting dead sites so i won&#039;t be going around looking up his name, but if you remember that person&#039;s name I bet he would make a good board member CT doesn&#039;t get along with.<br /><br />Also, editing would be great. However if you plan on making these first few journal entries the prologue you have to realize how fast you are going through the story. In just one chapter you have set up the entire backstory, while in a good amount of novels it takes the first half of the book to do so. Space it out a bit, somehow. There is a lot of potential with characters that die since anything they learn dies with them, so writing in a soldier&#039;s standpoint in either the camp raid, the retaliation mission or the attack on the R &amp; D base could be helpful so you can get the background info in without having your main character take a full look around EVERY room he goes into, but still getting it to a decent length. In other words, take your time, even if this isn&#039;t the most fun part to write about (I know the feeling).

It would be great to have lots of people, but the chat needs to be able to function (as in less nonsense, more conversation). My logic is this:<br /><br /><strong>IF</strong> Amount of Moderation = Amount of People * Rowdiness, <strong>THEN</strong> Chat is good.<br /><strong><br />IF</strong> Amount of Moderation &lt; Amount of People * Rowdiness, <strong>THEN</strong> Chat is chaotic.<br /><br /><strong>IF</strong> Amount of Moderation &gt; Amount of People * Rowdiness, <strong>THEN</strong> Chat is too strict.<br /><br />The value of moderation can change with the person viewing the chat, as well as the rowdiness. Currently the chat has no moderation or if the mod powers are given out wrongly even negative moderation, making chat more chaotic. We don&#039;t have a lot of people though, but there are a lot of cool features that do distract from the fact that it is a chat and make it more rowdy. So if moderators apply enough force to keep the amount of people and rowdiness in check without being too strict, then we have the ideal chat, getting better the higher amount of values are on all sides. Of course, since how much moderation is too much/little moderation and the general level of rowdiness are based on personal opinion, some people might have different views of the ideal chat. That said, if the majority of people think chat is too chaotic then we need to balance out the formula by either adding more moderation, lowering the amount of people (last resort tactic) and the rowdiness of the chat room.<br /><br />TL;DR: Basically, we want to increase moderation or lower the rowdiness of the room before lowering the amount of people, since the less amount of people in chat the less fun (as a general rule).
