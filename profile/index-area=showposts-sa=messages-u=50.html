					<br /><br />Yep. they should be long &amp; sleek =D<br />I think with or without the visual of a driver would be fine. I don&#039;t think its going to effect game play either way.<br />I do like the tron style body kits . <br />&nbsp;When you scope you change views anyway so I don&#039;t think it would matter unless the bikes had a different aiming system. As mentioned above if they had front or nose mounted weapons then you wouldn&#039;t be able to aim your weapon unless you moved your bike but possibly some weapons could be mounted underneath. Opposite of a car which would make strafing easier. I can see them having a fixed aimer for the nose mounted weapons.

The thing most people are forgetting about the android&#039;s speed is not it&#039;s actual speed, but it&#039;s acceleration, being able to change directions almost instantly to dodge bullets (unlike the car). The bike would not have that advantage. The weapon ideas are nice like missile pods and mounted chainguns but most would have the disadvantage of being only front firing, so a bike would have to use it&#039;s superior agility to line up with it&#039;s target and the car would have to use it&#039;s 360 weapon systems to shoot down a hoverbike before it can line up and deal damage. There would also be a rather clear and large weak spot on the bike (the rider) and it would be rather vulnerable to regular androids.<br /><br />Even if it is overpowered, it can always be an alternative to the car with the ability to eject (though the ejecting android is bound to have taken damage).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>actually FCA, i think he means the hoverbike to be a vehicle like the racer and sprinter. not an add-on for androids. mehenny, correct me if i&#039;m wrong. but the android in this pic will only be a hologram like thing on the bike and would have nothing to do with it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />&nbsp;Yeahh. your right. it is just a hologram/graphic. You could even have hoverbikes enclosed without the visual of a pilot would be fine for some models.&nbsp; I hadn&#039;t thought of only front firing weapons but it does make sense.. guess it would change your tactics a bit.

Maybe full life but less armor. Speed might make up for it.&nbsp; They could have a turbo option- a charge meter that can get them to top speed or a little faster for a few seconds.

So the baseline model should only be a little faster than the baseline car model but with better handling, quicker turning &amp; better acceleration. I&#039;m not sure why it couldn&#039;t have a initial lower armor value than a car since its half the size. Maybe at higher levels the difference wouldn&#039;t be that noticeable but the idea is that they are smaller &amp; quicker so they wouldn&#039;t lug heavy armor unless it was a top of the line model with a powerful engine to compensate for the weight. maybe you could just do a engine upgrade for each model with cash for the store. As you buy armor for the hover bike it would tell you what the weight would effect on your bike such as -15% acceleration for ultra blast tech armor,-10% turning or similar. A high end engine may compensate with +33% acceleration. Maybe a body mod could be added to help turning( +mod%). It may over complicate but its just a idea so you have to balance your hoverbike out. I don&#039;t think they should have &quot;bad&quot; flying agility. There supposed to be maneuvarable. Maybe just put a limit on the height they fly compared to cars. several hundred feet or so.

					oh yeahh. I had the same problem with a map i spent a lot of time on.. well 4 hours but for a broken map its awhile. In the map maker it looked great &amp; had a top to it but it did the weird spike think as yours did. My ice killer map while still playable was missing the mountain graphics so it has platforms hanging in the sky.<br /><br />&nbsp;I did exactly that with my last map. the platform was all resized and recolored blocks. but i would like to fix all my maps. I guess you can limit the size of mountains to avoid the spike glitch.

					&nbsp;Hi all. I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not the only one who has made a map &amp; hasn&#039;t been able to reload it to fix some of the glitches or errors on the map. The link the map maker gives does not work for a reload of the map. Neither does the link from your personal maps on your profile. Is there a trick to reloading your map? Maybe a directory I haven&#039;t seen.&nbsp; Also the paste feature doesn&#039;t work on the map loader. Any suggestions or all the maps you make doomed to not being able to be modified?

I think they could cut the life of androids in half which would solve some problems in fair play. they do have have limits on their jet pack &amp; touching them with your car kills them so its not completely unfair but the weapon accuracy with cars vs. androids could be redone. Maybe add a ejection function that could be damaged when trying to escape your vehicle(critical systems damage) A chance you blow yourself up instead of ejecting. The Android could also just be a graphic on the hoverbike with all damage going to the hoverbike. The damage I suggested probably would be more realistic with a chance of hitting the driver or the hoverbike or both with an explosive weapon.

Think of the new Hoverbikes as a new vehicle not as a add on for androids. The androids don&#039;t have to be part of the hover bike per say any more than they do in a car except on ejection.&nbsp; I also said I agree that androids could be nerfed on life &amp; that targeting them could be made a lot better. My other idea would be to have critical damage( on less than 5% life there&#039;s a chance ejection systems,drive train or weapons are damaged) for any vehicle that prohibits ejecting,driving properly or changing weapons, but that&#039;s not all that important, it&#039;s just a thought of adding something small to the game.<br />&nbsp;Ok.. so maybe there could be some map add ons that you could select not allowing hoverbikes on certain maps or androids from ejecting or even flight as I mentioned for the Death Race maps. It probably would be hard hitting them if they were faster than cars but they would have 1/2&nbsp; the life of a car with less armor. A more armored hoverbike would fly slower for sure.<br />

					<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;With the Hover Bike idea you would have two ways to kill them. One, -Snipe the driver or two,- destroy the bike. Even if they bailed out they would already be damaged(more than likely). I don&#039;t see how driving a hover bike would be that much different than a car except the higher speed/less armor &amp; guns. we can scrap the sidecar idea if it unbalances things.<br /><br />&nbsp;Hover craft might be good as well.. maybe not as fast as a car but bigger with varied weapon layouts.<br /><br />&nbsp;DeathRace would be a one way track with random &amp; preset traps that can maim or kill the drivers. The winner or top 3 players lets say get bonus cash + prestige of some sort. Anything would go. Ram players into traps. Lay &amp; wait with a missile barrage or block them with a movable object while they get attacked by bots but no bailing out of your car or flying on these maps. Perhaps low ceiling 30 feet or so.

					&nbsp;I&#039;m sure this may have been mentioned before but what&nbsp; about Hover Bikes of some sort? I&#039;m thinking they would be faster than some cars for a base model but can only use smaller weapons such as lasers. A rocket launcher would be too large(especially the multi missile one). They would be easier to fly in a straight line but perhaps couldn&#039;t fly above a couple hundred feet or so.<br /><br />&nbsp;Damage could be divided between android &amp; vehicle( as the android is exposed). Destroying the android with a well aimed shot blows up the hover bike as well. More expensive hover bikes could have a canopy that shields the driver from the front.<br /><br />&nbsp;A side car could be purchased that allows another player to ride in your hover bike and use his gun.<br /><br />&nbsp;Decals &amp; body kits could be bought as well to make that sleek look!<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;I know everyone won&#039;t be receptive to the idea but it I can already picture hover bike maps. Maybe a special map mode like the movie &quot;Death Race&quot; no respawn until the first person crosses the finish line or everyone else is dead. =D<br />
