RACE would be invincible. deathrace would be a normal CC game (with the race of course). i dont agree with pickups, and again. custom maps dude. how are you going to program CC to have it generate auto checkpoints AND pickups on a custom map? and i think i said it before but ( no checkpoints) when you die you should respawn where you died/ a few meters behind that (what ARE the measurements in CC anyway?! meters? yards?) my god, dont turn this into a post about wich weapons are OP or not. we already made about 4 other posts for shotgun ( wich bw im still making my point about the other weapons that have been here BEFORE the shotgun and need balancing too) its a deathrace, wich means damage is allowed ( btw all maps arnt gonna be some small circle). you cant just exclude&nbsp; 2 weapons BECAUSE it kills to good. (also what n00bs? anybody who comes to custom maps have to have an acount, and if they ARE guests they dont reply/ talk so they dont race anyway.) that&#039;s like saying you dont want a certain food because it tastes too good. you have other foods but just because that one&#039;s different does that mean you&#039;re going to stop eating it?!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br /><br />1.thats what I&#039;m saying, you can put checkpoints in the map maker, but there are also some official racing maps (like chokepoint, battle island) but for racing, you have to have a minimum of 2 checkpoints, start and finish I don&#039;t see your problem with checkpoints, explain please?<br />5. It can be strategic, if theres a bit your cars not good at (e.g. bumpy offroad bit and there are lots of other people with offroad kit, then you can take that bit out<br />5.2 which bit are you talking about, the boost?<br />7. yep race should be invins, again the pickups are don in the map, no that would be to lenient on racers (the car)<br />who have gone offtrack, hardly any delay at all because of its accel, ok ok, there are lots of op weapons compared to stuff like the plasma, i get your point, but still, and the maps would have to be biggish, with big tracks (shouldnt be a prob for you americans)<br /><br /><br />ok NOW is that reasonable too you?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>1/5. ah, well i rather have a barrier or clear marking on the track so people wont go off. destroying it is my main problem, if its part of the track why should you be able to skip it?<br />5.2. no the button that the host presses to start the race.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />oh, your thinking of proper racing tracks, sure racing tracks would have that, but offroad and open world stuff you just cant have barriers, you need to be able too choose your route not just sticking to the road, that way you can do awesome stuff like going through buildings<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>im not getting exactly what you&#039;re saying.

RACE would be invincible. deathrace would be a normal CC game (with the race of course). i dont agree with pickups, and again. custom maps dude. how are you going to program CC to have it generate auto checkpoints AND pickups on a custom map? and i think i said it before but ( no checkpoints) when you die you should respawn where you died/ a few meters behind that (what ARE the measurements in CC anyway?! meters? yards?) my god, dont turn this into a post about wich weapons are OP or not. we already made about 4 other posts for shotgun ( wich bw im still making my point about the other weapons that have been here BEFORE the shotgun and need balancing too) its a deathrace, wich means damage is allowed ( btw all maps arnt gonna be some small circle). you cant just exclude&nbsp; 2 weapons BECAUSE it kills to good. (also what n00bs? anybody who comes to custom maps have to have an acount, and if they ARE guests they dont reply/ talk so they dont race anyway.) that&#039;s like saying you dont want a certain food because it tastes too good. you have other foods but just because that one&#039;s different does that mean you&#039;re going to stop eating it?!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br /><br />1.thats what I&#039;m saying, you can put checkpoints in the map maker, but there are also some official racing maps (like chokepoint, battle island) but for racing, you have to have a minimum of 2 checkpoints, start and finish I don&#039;t see your problem with checkpoints, explain please?<br />5. It can be strategic, if theres a bit your cars not good at (e.g. bumpy offroad bit and there are lots of other people with offroad kit, then you can take that bit out<br />5.2 which bit are you talking about, the boost?<br />7. yep race should be invins, again the pickups are don in the map, no that would be to lenient on racers (the car)<br />who have gone offtrack, hardly any delay at all because of its accel, ok ok, there are lots of op weapons compared to stuff like the plasma, i get your point, but still, and the maps would have to be biggish, with big tracks (shouldnt be a prob for you americans)<br /><br /><br />ok NOW is that reasonable too you?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>1/5. ah, well i rather have a barrier or clear marking on the track so people wont go off. destroying it is my main problem, if its part of the track why should you be able to skip it?<br />5.2. no the button that the host presses to start the race.

					uhm, no. for one the rail of all things wouldnt be affected. one its super-accurate. two, its made of energy, its too fast to be effected by wind anyway! why would we want to create more lag the higher you go! matter of fact the wind gets weaker the higher you go. once you get past the air currents/turbulence you&#039;re pretty much heading for space. and wind is caused by the movement of clouds over an area so that still would work. also why would you want it to effect our weapons?! glider is a totally different thing ( even though i still say no, but yes to the temp boost working with glider too)

					im all for it, but some things need to be tweaked.<br />1. if anything flying would be somthing ill back up no prob, but remember all maps arnt perfect. you can get launched out of the course, or flipped over in a position that doesnt let you flip over.<br />2. race and death-race should be separate, and they&#039;re both game modes. not options.<br />3. why not grapple? of course there will be trollers grappling people. but other than that i dont see a prob. matter of fact, why not have everything allowed?! ill tell you why/how in a bit...<br />4. i would rather either flags or flares ( not too flashy please for lag reasons).<br />5. but i dont agree with making them destroy-able&nbsp; this isnt timed is it?! how are you going to have a timer on a custom map?! it should be totally new, as in program the modes like mario kart ( race mode wouldnt have weapons of course) once you all line up. maybe a button for ready? then the stoplights goes down to green. but you can still explore. it only lets you race when you AND other people press ready. you wont be able to go in a race with somebody who&#039;s already halfway across. <img src="../../Smileys/akyhne/tongue.gif" alt="&#58;P" title="Tongue" class="smiley" /><br />6. maybe if you didnt touch any sides?.. no no, not all maps have that.. im not sure about the last one.<br />7. ok, my proposal for #3... its just a race (this goes for deathrace too[ unless.. ill tell you later]). so everybody should be invincible. race would let nothing except grapple, items ( not mines?), kits, and armour in. while deathrace lets you have all the destructive weapons and mines. with both you will be invincible. emp nades and mines will still stop you. and grapple will still tmep stun your car, but you never die... EVER <img src="../../Smileys/akyhne/cheesy.gif" alt="&#58;D" title="Cheesy" class="smiley" /> anyway, with deathrace there could be an option that you DO die ( it will be more work though, i warn). if somebody dies, they get respawned like usual but either have the option to wait for next &quot;round&quot; or get respawned where they left off.

					i dont like that. why not have everything people like? why only 2 per user, what if they had multiple ideas people liked? it doesnt make sense to exclude about 10 other ideas that could potentially be the factor that pulls in somebody that would be crucial to this game/forum.
