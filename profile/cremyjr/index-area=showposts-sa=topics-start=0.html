					I was in a CTf just now. The use Bigfm or something like that was at the blue base and I noticed he had ninja invis. on. So I took my EMP nade launcher and Shot the proximity around him, yet none of the shots registered even though I can see it exploded right next to him. Later on in the game he was at my base waiting for the flag to respawn. I took my EMP launcher again and shot him 7 times directly! Yet only around 3-4 registered. Even then, they only did 6 damage (When they would do way more to an armour like that), and still didn&#039;t stun him at all. No he didn&#039;t have temp invince activated, don&#039;t ask me that dumb question. ~_~

					So I just have a simple proposal. You know how that nub always activates temp whenever you&#039;re about to pwn them? And run off to get a health pick up (or regenerate health), in which, by the time you get to them they&#039;re good to go and surprise your with a rail to the windshield?<br />Well how about we give the temp. invincibility it&#039;s time and charges (uses) back in exchange for this double damage? So whenever the time runs out, for a 2-4 second frame, all damage (even collision) will be doubled. That way, you&#039;ll have to think twice before activating it.

					I was looking at all my stuff in the shop today. I looked at my load-out from last time which included &quot;Temp. shield&quot; And &quot;Glider&quot;. Note that you can turn the glider on and off (So to speak).<br />But before I continue, please remember this is a visual effect and if you guys like it, I&#039;d like it to be implemented last. (We have bigger problems to worry about)<br />I&#039;m sure you all know that when you have armor equipped, your car health and armor health are separate. And that when your armour health is depleted, you no longer get the protection from it. So in the event that you somehow get your armour bar to 0 before your health, how about your armour fall off? Explode? Shatter? Ect? I&#039;m sure you get the drift here now. The only thing I can&#039;t picture in my head is, what would happen if you got a health pickup? Would your armour assimilate out of thin air like Samus&#039;s suit? (Sooper sexy gal from game called Metriod. Look her up)<br />Also, if you guys want, maybe when your armour falls off your stats can go back to normal. So if you had heavy armour, and it was destroyed, then your speed would increase.<br />I also think it&#039;s a good idea because what of your body-kits like diamond and gold? It&#039;d be pretty cool to shoot off someones&#039; ninja regen armour, thinking you&#039;ve got them, to see this golden sonofa&#039; gun to blast you.

					It&#039;s not actually a HUD, but I&#039;m not really sure what it&#039;s called <img src="../../Smileys/akyhne/tongue.gif" alt="&#58;P" title="Tongue" class="smiley" /><br />Anyways, it&#039;s in most games and has a red arc that shows the general direction in which you were just attacked. This would not work with ninja for balancing reasons. And I said general because if you get shot from the bottom left or top left it will still be registered as though you got hit to the left.

					Okeys, so this would be an item that acts similar to a mine. When activated, it will drop behind your car (about 75% bigger than the car [and round of course]). What makes it different from the mines is that when activated in air, it will float instead of falling to the ground! It will also be drawn to cars (not too fast maybe around 5-10 mph?). When hit (level 20), it will also stun you for 5 seconds- Making a good combo item (maybe even a one way death trip, depending on damage and how many you set up [also if they all hit of course]) for those pesky flying people!

As *soon* as I played (and loved) DCUO, I imminently searched if Marvel had a MMORPG. Sadly they didn&#039;t yet. But I kept an eye out and found Marvel Heroes about 4-5 months ago. As soon as they announced Closed-Beta applications were being accepted, I signed up the first day! They just sent me an email with a key code to test and comment on the game!!!!! I&#039;m so excited!!! Here&#039;s the link to DCUO: <a href="https://www.dcuniverseonline.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.dcuniverseonline.com/</a> Here&#039;s the link to Marvel Heroes: <a href="https://marvelheroes.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://marvelheroes.com/</a>

					Well we all know grapple is just for fun... literally, you can&#039;t really use it for crap in battle. the only way you can kill is if collision damage is on and you drag&nbsp; the person to death, granted the don&#039;t hover or YOU dont kill yourself first. and the only other use would be to grapple the player who&#039;s the most threat to you team in TDM and CTF. even then, they still might shoot you.<br />soooo, i think the grapple should have another fun aspect. it&#039;s very simple actually: the grapple usually pulls a person right? but what if you didnt HAVE to drive to pull the person? there would be a new button ( any one we don&#039;t use that&#039;s close to WASD, doesnt matter) that would reel the person you grappled toward you (it would be press and hold). you don&#039;t even have to move! i think you should also be able to press another button (sorry for all the button, I don&#039;t think a toggle would work for this since it&#039;s pulling/pushing you) and it would let the line go slack as the distance between you increase (basically it&#039;ll let the person do whatever but once you let go the line it locks again)<br />Also, tired of having your friend have to exit the car so they can slowly pull you? well there would be another button (most likely F since it&#039;s a nice toggle button) that would reverse the direction and let the person you grappled pull you!<br />both of these combined will make the non-damaging grapple an epic weapon.. or should i say tool! tired of falling down that stupid mountain? are you always getting stuck when bungee jumping? well you need the handy dandy grappling hooook! XD lol, that way you can reverse the direction, press and hold reel, and pull yourself up the 90 degree cliff! ( all spy/batman like XD). comments? questions?

					ok, this is JoJet&#039;s idea. basically&nbsp; for TDM and DM, you can (instead of the regular time) choose to make the match stock. you would be able to choose how many stocks a person can have, going up to a max a of 20. since we can&#039;t really have sliders yet, but a set option, maybe they can go from 5-10-15-20.

					man, i wish i had some more conversation out of this one but then again it was only me Blazing and JoJet... anyway, i was playing around with devastator, standing on a cliff with my broke on when i thought... what if we had some battle treads?! i&#039;m just gonna get down to business cuz im hungry...<br />basically, when you have this kit on, just like the glider, you press &quot;f&quot; and these spikes come out your wheel ( 1-2 inches maybe? btw, it won&#039;t be just 4 spikes, these spikes will be all around the wheel, right next to each other). when you have your battle-treads out, not only will you be able drive on ANY tangible suface, but you will also be able to CLING to any surface at ANY angle! even upside down! Also, when driving over a car (ohh btw, you can drive over cars&nbsp; lol) or dropping on them like a hawk, your spike will do minimal damage (about the same as some minigun hits?) psh, battle treads? more like spiderman treads! <img src="../../Smileys/akyhne/cheesy.gif" alt="&#58;D" title="Cheesy" class="smiley" /> anyway, this will be great for finding impossible sniper spots (i mean, CTF for example, who exactly goes in a base and expects to find a defender... UPSIDE DOWN on the roof?!) and just for over all fun!!! i&#039;m thinking maybe when you go over cars, you can maybe cling to them and hitchhike? wut u guys think about that part, too much?

					Face it, we all know shock armour sucks. another great idea from me and speed! know how when two cars ram into each other? at least one, if not both people go flying. but with this upgrade to the shock armour, that wont happen! instead the person with it on won&#039;t go flying! it will also &quot;absorb&quot; ALL impact, making weapon fire impossible to make it &quot;flinch&quot; or budge, not even plasma blaster or laser cannon! (what i mean is, you still take damage, but your car won&#039;t even move!) also, even though it won&#039;t have as much protection as heavy or even ninja, it will have the ability (when you travel at least 50 mph) to &quot;push&quot; a person a few feet. the faster you go, the farther they&#039;re pushed. this will make (despite its poor protection) the shock armour improved and because of it&#039;s abilities, able to stand beside heavy and assault armour on terms of a &quot;crowd control&quot; armour!

					An idea from Gex, Speed, and I! It&#039;s pretty simple.<br />this weapon will do damage a bit more popwerful than the flamethrower... that is on one car! <img src="../../Smileys/akyhne/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" /> this weapon has the power to shoot out electrical arcs that jump from one car to another. but to make it balanced, every car it touches the damage decreases. this will be great for crowd control or the &quot;hawk&quot; method where you take a position on 2 or more people fighting and shoot em! <img src="../../Smileys/akyhne/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" /> the radius is infinite in a sense. meaning, once there are cars close enough together, you can shoot somebody from the red base on battle island from the blue base (once you have enough people) once you have somebody targeted, the radius of when it &quot;jumps&quot; to another car should be about the size of a base.

					ok, Speed and I were talking yesterday. We agreed that at level 10, the laser cannon and plasma blaster (energy weapons) should have a shock-wave&nbsp; for it not be be OP (plus since it IS additional damage[like flamethrower]) at level 10 a small shock-wave (a circle about the length of a car?) will spread through the ground when it hits the ground/walls/ cars (maybe have the shock-wave hit very close cars?). at level 10, the wave would be 1% additional damage, and every time you level it up till 20 would be 1 additional percent of damage it does.

					ok, im gonna get off soon but ill make this as quick and simple as possible. ask questions if needed.<br />so basically ninja regen and samurai regen combined and made ultimate regen armour.&nbsp; It will have as much armour as both. as youve prob guessed already it will regen BOTH armour AND health.<br />now for you guys who think it&#039;l be OP. it will regen them at half the rate the current ones do. also itl take 1/2 as long to start ( not it will be half time to start im saying say it takes 3 second to start regen. with this one it will take 3 1/2 maybe even 4[ first few levels]).<br />now to keep it in competition without OP it we DO have to give it SOME power. soooo, when you upgrade to 15-20 it will regen more and fast (about the same rate and stuff as a level 5 or 10 regen.<br /><br />Removed sexual reference from text.&nbsp; -Nattyfrank

					ZOMG GUYS! im on a roll here! i was thinking of final smashes from SSBB (Super Smash Bros. Brawl, i was watching youtube vids) and thought of&nbsp; a stupid weapon &quot;asteroid strike&quot; when i thought. hey! what if the whole map was in &quot;space&quot; let me not get ahead of myself... heres how it works.<br />it would be a weather option titled &quot;space&quot; sooo, when there the map will having nothing changed. EXCEPT, it will look dark (like the night option) and stars will light up the backround pic. say on battle island you go to the boundary, since in space it will be cut off. when driven off, you will have 5 (or is it 10?) seconds to fly back up and in bounds. hey maybe we can even have the water falling off in a infinite waterfall!<br />anyway, every 5-10 seconds a meteor (actually it will vary. more up ahead) will fall from nowhere (you could be by blue base and it will hit red base and you wont even know) it will be completely random (but it WILL target areas that players go the most over areas they dont[ except on custom maps in which it will just target COMPLETELY random spots over the main area]).<br />now there will be different types. there will be &quot;meteors, comets, asteroids, and shooting/falling stars&quot; each will do different damage. meteors/meteorites (meaning they will vary in size with the plain meteor the biggest) will do small damage. about 5-10% and may have a 50% chance of burning (you will burn if hit)<br />asteroids which are bigger will do 10-15% but have only have 25% chance of burning.<br />now comets will do 15-20% damage and temp. (for a second or two) stop functions in your car (because of ice, although if the ice [factors, weapons, etc] get in then ill put my full ideas in in which include a chance to freeze the car and making the tires freeze[ which will make you slide])<br />shooting/falling stars will do the most damage (since they are in fact flaming balls of gas) at a whopping 20-25% and will ALWAYS have 100% chance of &quot;burning&quot; which technically makes the damage 20-30%.<br /><br /><br />im also thinking about lighting. tell me your thoughts on if i should do a post about electricity (factors, weapons, etc)

					hey guys, just sayin know how flames go out when underwater? well how bout we make it even MORe realistic.<br />first, have the flames burn on the ground and do damage to anybody who drives/walks through it (and also they will start burning). it would stay for dif times. when on grass for a long time maybe 8-10 seconds? when on sand, mud, watery (but not water itself) surfaces 5 seconds or so. when on tiles (like in custom maps) it would stay for about 5-8 seconds.<br />also, when blowing up oil canisters on battle island the debris (since its flaming) should also burn and catch you on fire.<br />also i havnt fully figured out how bout there should be some way that you could just spray the oil (without lighting it [wich is how the flamethrower works{or if not oil it COULD sometimes be powdered coal}]) and when you DO let the flames come out when the doused person lights up they stay on fire longer and the flames do more damage. also, sadly with all the realism going on when entering water (or if already in water) the oil will slide of and float at the top (hey maybe that way we can even light the WATER on fire![yes yes, it&#039;s posible and has been done in real life]).
