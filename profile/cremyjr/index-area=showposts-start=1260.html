The bike would not have that advantage. The weapon ideas are nice like missile pods and mounted chainguns but most would have the disadvantage of being only front firing, so a bike would have to use it&#039;s superior agility to line up with it&#039;s target and the car would have to use it&#039;s 360 weapon systems to shoot down a hoverbike before it can line up and deal damage.

My ice killer map while still playable was missing the mountain graphics so it has platforms hanging in the sky.<br /><br />&nbsp;I did exactly that with my last map. the platform was all resized and recolored blocks. but i would like to fix all my maps. I guess you can limit the size of mountains to avoid the spike glitch.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I made a Dangerous Craters map, where all the terrain was raised, and there were holes in it, and inside the holes were Explosive Canisters.<br /><br /><br />I played it and, it was all broken.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>the canisters was broken?

It was never explained properly in the game that the ejecting person was a &quot;android&quot;. that doesn&#039;t mean there can&#039;t be v2.0 android&nbsp; that perhaps moves slow but has a bigger gun for example and a recharging shield.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>no dude, ur not getting it. just becuase you put negative effects doesnt balance it out. even though it will &quot;move slow&quot; a regen sheild AND bigger gun? do you know how hard it is to kill an andoid flying? much less without lag! stop trying to make androids strongber, that&#039;s not there purpose. if anything i saw make them weaker.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I never said make them immortal. it was simply a idea that you don&#039;t have to agree with. First, you would play test it to see if it could be done fairly. Isn&#039;t that the point of beta testing? You seem to get offended when someone has a idea other than making them weaker. My thoughts were once the shield takes a direct rocket hit or sustained chain gun fire for a few seconds the shield would drop &amp; only re activate once the android had time to regenerate it. Perhaps they would move slow &amp; not fly like their smaller cousins. Only hop maybe. As for the android problem in general. It may be just a targeting issue that can be reworked. I&#039;ve had androids in my sights &amp; still miss them with my chain gun(fully unloading a mag) but maybe thats a game mechanics problem. that can be resolved. Maybe the scope can be reworked to zoom in further to hit the pesky androids better or they should take more damage with sustained fire.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>i didnt say u said anything like that. i dont think anybody said i was offended. you&#039;re the only person who&#039;s put an idea for making them stronger. and again, thats my whole point. they WERNT made to even stand a chance against cars. they&#039;re already OP in many situations. giving them an advantage much less a vehicle is WAAY out of bounds.&quot; I&#039;ve had androids in my sights &amp; still miss them with my chain gun(fully unloading a mag) but maybe thats a game mechanics problem.&quot; this is wut i mean, theyre so hard to kill as it is. why make them even stronger?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />&nbsp;I wasn&#039;t the only person to suggest a change. The first part of this thread was about android armor. I think they could cut the life of androids in half which would solve some problems in fair play. they do have have limits on their jet pack &amp; touching them with your car kills them so its not completely unfair but the weapon accuracy with cars vs. androids could be redone. Maybe add a ejection function that could be damaged when trying to escape your vehicle(critical systems damage) A chance you blow yourself up instead of ejecting. The Android could also just be a graphic on the hoverbike with all damage going to the hoverbike. The damage I suggested probably would be more realistic with a chance of hitting the driver or the hoverbike or both with an explosive weapon. Saying giving the androids a vehicle is unfair is odd since they already pilot the cars. How is that different? It just seems like it since the android would be visible but supposedly their in the cars anyway..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>ah, i remember now. but that still doesnt make it right even though you make negatives with it. and even though that is true, tell me how much will you sucsecfully hit one? who will actually stay on the ground? nobody butguests. everybody else will fly. do you know how hard it is to hit one in air? even with sprinter and it&#039;s flying agility. im not totally getting wut ur saying with this &quot;&nbsp; Maybe add a ejection function that could be damaged when trying to escape your vehicle(critical systems damage) A chance you blow yourself up instead of ejecting.&quot; do u mean a percent chance to have a malfunction? or is it that the car would get shot in certain places that will not let you eject? and again, not every weapon is an explosive or railgun. and thats the difference, the android is in the car, being able to eject. its not just a visual, wut ur saying is that u would be able to drive even faster. its hard enough to kill them now, why would we make them be able to go WAAY faster? it&#039;s unfair. either keep it as a newvehicle or scrap it. there&#039;s no need to make androids stronger.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />You completely miss what I&#039;m saying in my suggestions. Think of the new Hoverbikes as a new vehicle not as a add on for androids. The androids don&#039;t have to be part of the hover bike per say any more than they do in a car except on ejection.&nbsp; I also said I agree that androids could be nerfed on life &amp; that targeting them could be made a lot better. My other idea would be to have critical damage( on less than 5% life there&#039;s a chance ejection systems,drive train or weapons are damaged) for any vehicle that prohibits ejecting,driving properly or changing weapons, but that&#039;s not all that important, it&#039;s just a thought of adding something small to the game.<br />&nbsp;Ok.. so maybe there could be some map add ons that you could select not allowing hoverbikes on certain maps or androids from ejecting or even flight as I mentioned for the Death Race maps. It probably would be hard hitting them if they were faster than cars but they would have 1/2&nbsp; the life of a car with less armor. A more armored hoverbike would fly slower for sure.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> ah! i see. well if thats wut u mean, then the android inside would have to be a hologram and not have to do anything with the bike itself. on ur other idea, it sounds very firmiliar. somebody had an idea like that. i cant remember wut or who but i know it was an idea. now with the map options, im not to sure y u&#039;r excluding hover bikes itself. if its a vehicle it will be able to go on any server. there&#039;s already an option for no androids. no flight. maaybe. idk how that would effect glider though O.o and this &quot;&nbsp; It probably would be hard hitting them if they were faster than cars but they would have 1/2&nbsp; the life of a car with less armor. A more armored hoverbike would fly slower for sure.&quot; what exactly are the stats for this car? it has to be equal. and its a vehicle, it cant have half life and less armour. if u buy heavy armour for sprinter. its the same amount of life as if u equipped it for racer. the only armour that slows down is heavy armour.

Also, keep in mind that the percent is floored, so if you have 99% you could have anywhere from 990 to 999 XP for that particular level.

Thought this was already discussed...<br /><br />Now I&#039;m a little confused on what you are try to say here:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="../../carbon-combat/garrage-idea/msg735/index.html#msg735">Quote from: cremyjr on <span title=" 27, 2012, 05:24:00 pm" style="cursor:default">Late July, 2012</span></a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">stuff like preformance things that will up the stats of your car (it would stay no matter what car you have[if you buy some thing that boosts your accel on sprinter and switched to racer it would have the same gear]) ALTHOUGH i do NOT agree with downfalls. if i want to have negatives. it will still be balanced. CC would have about 75% of everything (all these are if you bought all upgrades or whtevr) racer would have more everything but top speed and flying agility would still be be less than the rest. same with the rest (if you know wut i mean)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If you mean we can install performance upgrades into our car without penalties, then I have to disagree. I like the idea of adding modifiers like bigger engines and different tires (though I do realize it would be hard to model cosmetic variations, I still want it) but if there isn&#039;t a downfall then there is just another way new players are at a disadvantage. Why is it the pros get handling upgrades when they have likely by now gotten control of their car when new players are left with a stock car flying into walls? If you want to modify, you need to sacrifice something, whether it&#039;s a bigger engine giving more weight or high-grip racing tires making flying more chunky. We can still customize, but we don&#039;t need to do it at new player&#039;s expense.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t mean that, then please re-phrase or use better grammar. A bit hard to understand, see.<br /><br />As for this:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="../../carbon-combat/garrage-idea/msg735/index.html#msg735">Quote from: cremyjr on <span title=" 27, 2012, 05:24:00 pm" style="cursor:default">Late July, 2012</span></a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">BUT... the garage idea isnt like that &quot; The garage is where you equip your car with all the goodies you bought at the store. It would be a separate screen from the main menu and would show your car in an auto garage (possibly futuristic).&quot; no no, that&#039;s the inventory right there. what it does is let you maybye do stuff to ur car.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Then what is the garage? Just paint and car mods? If that&#039;s the case then we can just buy that stuff in the store. Besides, we would need a place to customize your paint job and the inventory screen has nothing to let us do that. A new screen is needed, and I suggested a replacement to the current inventory screen with the garage idea that lets us do paint, see our stats and swap our equipment and maybe mods.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>well i guess ur right. BUT, my point is i just dont want somthing like this. for ex. i have racer, more accel and handling than the rest. if i get all the mods, i still want at least mid better handling and accel no matter the consequence. otherwise, if u want ur car to have a certain aspect( more accel say with Combat car) you wouldnt get ALL the mods. only the ones that boost that aspect (maybe we could have a fliter?) also, i wsnt thinking of customizing ur CAR itself! i think the idea of tampering with wheels, spoilers ect is cool! and the last thing, are you saying to make a new window/screen yes but also have inventory AND garage on it?

One, -Snipe the driver or two,- destroy the bike. Even if they bailed out they would already be damaged(more than likely). I don&#039;t see how driving a hover bike would be that much different than a car except the higher speed/less armor &amp; guns. we can scrap the sidecar idea if it unbalances things.<br /><br />&nbsp;Hover craft might be good as well.. maybe not as fast as a car but bigger with varied weapon layouts.<br /><br />&nbsp;DeathRace would be a one way track with random &amp; preset traps that can maim or kill the drivers. The winner or top 3 players lets say get bonus cash + prestige of some sort. Anything would go. Ram players into traps. Lay &amp; wait with a missile barrage or block them with a movable object while they get attacked by bots but no bailing out of your car or flying on these maps. Perhaps low ceiling 30 feet or so.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>well let&#039;s leave the hover craft for right now. i dont think we should put another task in the schedule already right now. but anyway, thats my point. technically that&#039;s like 2 or 3 diff lives right there. not everybody has railgun, plus it&#039;s hard to shot them. and now they&#039;ll be going even faster? right before they die (by shooting the bike) they would eject and go on foot. just like we do now with the cars... when you say one way, do u mean like one giant strip? that would be drag racing. mabye i liiil bit higher ceiling? it would be cool to bounce off nades on stuff

First, you would play test it to see if it could be done fairly. Isn&#039;t that the point of beta testing? You seem to get offended when someone has a idea other than making them weaker. My thoughts were once the shield takes a direct rocket hit or sustained chain gun fire for a few seconds the shield would drop &amp; only re activate once the android had time to regenerate it. Perhaps they would move slow &amp; not fly like their smaller cousins. Only hop maybe. As for the android problem in general. It may be just a targeting issue that can be reworked. I&#039;ve had androids in my sights &amp; still miss them with my chain gun(fully unloading a mag) but maybe thats a game mechanics problem. that can be resolved.

I&#039;m thinking they would be faster than some cars for a base model but can only use smaller weapons such as lasers. A rocket launcher would be too large(especially the multi missile one). They would be easier to fly in a straight line but perhaps couldn&#039;t fly above a couple hundred feet or so.<br /><br />&nbsp;Damage could be divided between android &amp; vehicle( as the android is exposed). Destroying the android with a well aimed shot blows up the hover bike as well. More expensive hover bikes could have a canopy that shields the driver from the front.<br /><br />&nbsp;A side car could be purchased that allows another player to ride in your hover bike and use his gun.<br /><br />&nbsp;Decals &amp; body kits could be bought as well to make that sleek look!<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;I know everyone won&#039;t be receptive to the idea but it I can already picture hover bike maps.
