Also there is a hatch that protects the gunner that could incorporate the existing armours, but weaker. <br />The driver would have a smaller turret, maybe like a machine gun (see the machine gun thread) that is not changeable and is on the bonnet of the car.<br /><br /><br />The drivers view would be like the existing one but the gunners view would be like the scope view, but you can zoom in and out.<br /><br /><br />There would be a &#039;switch option&#039; where if one player presses it it shows on the other players screen and if they press it too they switch (in maybe 5 seconds), if the driver bails it will also tell the gunner and they would be able too switch as soon as they press the button without their team mate pressing it.<br />Also if there is one person still in the car it would not explode and within a certain radius around the car and maximum speed of maybe 10 mph the person out side the car could get by holding g for 3 seconds, it could be possible in a team game for two people in different cars without someone else in their car to join forces into one car (you exit your car and enter the others whilst they&#039;re under 10 mph, the other would explode)<br /><br /><br />In a co-op death match if the gunner dies they would respawn as a person and the driver could pick him/her up, if the driver dies then he/she would respawn in the car, if both are inactive (waiting to respawn) (died at the same time) then the time is added together and they respawn together.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Please give me a suggestion on how to lay it out better if you find it difficult too read.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>i love it! just some tweaks i think will help it balance out with the game. 1. it makes sense for it to be bigger. but lets not have it so big it has trouble getting in and out of the bases. 2. only have one weapon turrent. it should be one person drives. another shoots. i dont think they should have different veiws. it should shoulg be the sameveiw as it is now forboth of em. the driver can still scope to look around and stuff. he jus cant shoot. i think its a great idea! finally the sooter can focuse on sniping without the hassle of being on the move. OH! idea. there could be a box in the top right corner that lets you see what the other person&#039;s seeing. got this idea cuz say im gliding. the gunner is scopped on sombody who&#039;s on or trail. i look in the box and see the person shoot rockets. i can evade them and stuff! <img src="../../Smileys/akyhne/cheesy.gif" alt="&#58;D" title="Cheesy" class="smiley" /> not sure bout the wholeswitching thing..... i think i like the last part too.

					ok you guys. you&#039;re forgetting somthing. from mid range/afar. how much damage does it do? only one to two shells hit you. the only reason it&#039;s a one hit kill thing is becuease we go up close. since it a spray weapon we simply drive up close. thats the only reason its so powerfull. like really. what shotgun user do you know that killed domone in one or two shots from a distance? nobody. we all drive right next to the car.

While it does take the missile more shots to kill, the railgun has 1 clip and takes a while to reload. In that time you could get killed with the opponent at ~5-15%. And half the time, as FCA said, the missile launcher will mess up your aim. To me, it seems that missile launcher users always shoot just when I&#039;m about to shoot. Also, a missile launcher can reload and empty its clip while a rail reloads. And again, with your aim being messed up, you won&#039;t really have much of a chance with an experienced missile launcher user other than to switch to secondary weapon (plan B) or flee (or glide in my case, also known as plan C, Plan D is to turn on invincibility and fight to the death).<br /><br /><br />For regen----<br />While you can kill with two shots (three if you dont shoot before they regen enough HP), they can mess up your aim and stall so that they may heal themselves.<br />The first shot takes 50 damage away and the second takes away ~65 because of armor degrading.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>ok. not sure how to reply to those but youre missing the point. we&#039;re not trying to debate about the balnce between missle and railgun. the fact is its weaker than rocket when it should be stronger. it makes up for the weakness with its homing. but the homing sucks. increases its homing capacity and its power ( just a good bit) then if its OP compared to railgun up rail&#039;s power. cuz lets face it railgun is weak as it is right now anway.

It doesn&#039;t really require 100% precision. If you try to lock onto a far away player, the green light doesn&#039;t turn red to show you your locked but if your cross hair is on the player, it still homes. This happened to me before and I think it&#039;s some sort of glitch.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>not sure about the glitch part but no. its not. even though it homes at far distances (thank god) you need to have the scope right on the target when you fire. now add that to the fact that the target will be moving AND lag. it plain out sucks. also, didnt i do that test with you xd? rocket launcher takes 6 hits to kill a level 20 heavy armour. missle takes about what? 7 or 8? the missle is &quot;more powerful&quot; than the rocket launcher. im not saying make it more powerful. dim down the rocket&#039;s power (rocket should be a LIL stronger than missle). the missle makes up for its not-so-good power by homing. but since the homing sucks like this, its just plain weak.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Me and monthy performed an experiment once. We both had lvl 20 heavy. He had lvl 20 missiles. I had lvl 20 railgun. If nobody missed, missile launcher overpowers railgun. Railgun users are more likely to miss anyway because of the missile launcher messing up my aim :|. And messing up aim is easy because they can home.<br />Also they don&#039;t have to aim as much.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>yes but you forgot somthing. 1. you were stationary: if everybodies moving its harder to aim. 2. dude how many of us &quot;pro&quot; users cant kill with a railgun? donttry to say ur not good with it. and even then how much shots themselves does it take to kill? the reload time has nothing to do with it. if you try to change the reload time then the railgun will be OP sicne it reloads so quickly. if i remember right it takes 4 railgun shots. it takes more than 4 shots to kill with a missle.

It states that for each upgrade, the price increases, so getting one upgrade in the five-upgrade system will cost much more than getting one upgrade in the twenty-upgrade system.<br /><br /><br />This prevents people from getting maximum level in one day.<br /><br /><br />As for the interval thing, you&#039;re right, so maybe it could be a four or six upgrades system.<br /><br /><br />Well, it&#039;s either a new upgrade system, or perhaps make upgrades for certain guns more expensive than upgrades for weaker guns. Meaning, just as the shotgun costs more than the grenade launcher, so should its upgrades. What say you on that proposal?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I call this missing the target and hitting someone&#039;s crotch instead. Let me re-state what I was trying to say about upgrades:<br /><br /><br />The reason I don&#039;t like upgrades and don&#039;t like the idea behind them is that they upgrade a weapon so it is absolutely better than the previous version of the weapon. This would be fine and dandy in a single player game facing CPU opponents, but this is a multiplayer game facing humans. So every advantage you give to one player makes the other player&#039;s experience harder for them. We can still have a store and equipment, but they need to be balanced so that while one player may like one weapon better and perform better with it, another player may find it to be less effective. The best example of multiplayer like this is console shooters; COD is the shining example of a (mostly) balanced system of equipment swaps as well as BF, and while Halo still goes by old school pickups you need to play to a weapon or piece of equipment&#039;s strengths to use it effectively (for instance a tank will beat a standard armed soldier most days, but give that soldier an EMP or Anti-Vehicle weapon and they blow up the tank, though they are now more vulnerable to standard soldiers armed with anti-personal weapons). There still is a sense of upgrades in these games that crave, but it doesn&#039;t harm other players&#039; experiences. Sure if you need to earn these upgrades less people have them, but it is also harder for people to get leaving those who have them in a much better position.<br /><br /><br />Alternatively, we can up the power/starting upgrade level of the starting weapons or give players more starting credits to upgrade their equipment. That way (assuming we fix all the OP weapons) new players stand at least stand a chance against other more well-armed players, so the game is less about how long you have been playing and more about how skilled you are (AKA instead of saying &quot;if I had a shotgun I would have killed you&quot; you say &quot;damn, that guy has skills&quot;).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>alright. i agree with one thing. like most multiplayer games (with upgrades) you always have enough money to upgrade somthing at least twice or a powerful thing once. so yes new players should have a certain amount of starting creds. and that last part only noobs would say somthing like that. like i say the only reason we all started just like evrybody else, with a warhead and an energy blaster (idk why i said it like tht lol) but only becuase of our skill is the reason wwe got so much creds and in turn better weapons. so its not about what weapon we have. the only reason we got them in the first place is becuase of skill. face it, we have skill and got our fair share in creds, so why shouldnt we have access to better things either? and like i also said you dont have to have a railgun to be good. natty with plasma blaster. director with nades (now gone) and missle. me with minigun and flamethrower. and almost evry &quot;pro&quot; player can utilize a &quot;weak&quot; weapon.

Two things:<br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">Why put it as an upgrade? I don&#039;t really see the point personally, especially since power-up weapons are level 1 (so survival mode and weapon pickups don&#039;t utilize the missile launcher&#039;s power as nearly as much relative to other weapons).</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">I do find that hitting far-away targets with ease as the store claims is a far exaggeration&nbsp; but I think we could possibly do something that makes it easier to use the weapon at longer distances without actually changing the performance&nbsp; How about that when the missile launcher scopes, it has a higher zoom than other weapons? That way it is easier to line up the laser lock-on since you are able to see it more clearly. It&#039;s like a gun sight or scope; technically the gun performs just as good without it, but it is a lot harder to hit a target even so.</span></li></ul></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>two things. lucy im sorry but i will have to dissagree with most of it. and fca i agree with some. ok i agree with making it sronger as in the homing ability, but not with making it more powerfull. it&#039;s less powerfull than the rocket launcher but instead of increasing its power we should decrease rocket&#039;s power. i do like shadow&#039;s concept of realistic homing weapons wich WOULD have a bigger homing capacity becuase of heat emmiting from the target. i dont agree with scoping. i like the idea that missle, rail, and laser would scope but lets face it. the increased magnification also makes it very difficult. if you move your mouse to much you&#039;ll completly miss the target. i like it but it would also make it a bit more dificult. just have the homing capibilty increased like shadow sugjested.
