					hm.. i guess. but im still kinda leaning about it.<br />for the killstreaks. each should have a different time-frame of wich it&#039;s active. and somthing to let you know its almost up ( maybe blinking? for shields and stuff, and idk for things like bots).<br />Minor kill: 3, it should be five. i think 10 is the amount of time it is now if you have it. even if not, 10 seconds is too long for just 3 kills.<br />minor kill: 4, uhm, im preety sure a level 20 weapon drop should be somthing major...<br />major kill: 5, with the increased speed the time should go down.<br />major kill: 6, if the strike takes 10 seconds AND the target is warned i dont think that&#039;s very fair. it would be preety much useless unless they&#039;re complete idiots.<br />major kill: 7, lower the time a bit. 25? or 20? maybe depending on wich weapon you have?<br />major loss: 4, 50% is a bit too harsh,especially if the person already has 50% or less. or if collision damage is on even if they have more than that.<br />major loss: 5, it should be a defense bot, n attack bot should be a reward. not more of somthing your get for dying.<br /><br /><br />one more thing, for each amount of kills you posted 2 streak powers. why? if you ment it that when you get that number then you get BOTH streaks isnt fair.

					i love the second. but the loss streak isnt really good.<br />1. i know its not somthing to be proud of but lets be real, do n00bs really care about that? it would be unfair if you&nbsp; &nbsp; got a reward for getting killed. add that sheild item/ more health to a n00b LETTING themselves get killed (since they have nothing to loose) just to get that.<br />also, the combo&#039;s i hope you mean major and minor as in airstrike=major and 1/4 more speed=minor or somthing like that. or do you mean, i cant have two major streaks equipped? if that&#039;s the case i dont like it. i mean you&#039;ll have to choose either one, and it wont be forever.<br />also, this could be great with the different bots idea.

					oh please, thats fine bro. i understand what you mean. it IS very taxing responding to everbody&#039;s needs and trying to get them to like your idea. i would NEVER down an idea just because&nbsp; i always give reasons. i mean its logic too, why not eat somthing, when you have no reason not to? is it poisonous&nbsp; no, is it going to hurt you in anyway? no, is it tasty? its up too you, but you&#039;ll never know if you dont try! same for ideas, it&#039;s straight bull if people say somthing is OP, but they never give a reason. &quot;Me: dude, why do u think that? Random Person: because, it just IS! Me: really bro? -_-&quot; thts why with my newer posts with polls i always say to give a reason.

					<strong><br />==Corrected Post==</strong><br />Okay then, let&#039;s get serious here. There&#039;s so much tension in this thread; I don&#039;t know how to explain it! It makes me sad. We&#039;re all a family, right? I feel like we&#039;re all about to explode on this post, but everybody&#039;s just keeping it coiled up, just waiting to strike... Anybody else feel like that? Anyway, let&#039;s get back on topic.<br /><br />Director, it wouldn&#039;t make any sense to do that <em>now</em>. <br />1. Even if we do take them out, what would be the purpose of still keeping them? Why give them out free when they&#039;re called &quot;premium?&quot;<br /><br />2. I guess I&#039;m fine with either way, but if we <em>do</em> take them out, I want my money back or <em>something</em> because I still have leftover premium creds.<br /><br />Uhm Lamp: I&#039;m glad for your idea but why make that site anyway? It just looks like another forum! I mean, what would people (new players - what it&#039;s made for I guess) do and talk about there anyway?<br /><br />Agreed Natty. If you were a new player on a site where everybody has epic weapons that kill like terminator but you couldn&#039;t get it because you had to pay (I would have no problem, but what if it was like now? How some people&#039;s parents won&#039;t let them, they don&#039;t have money, or simply the site has technical difficulties that won&#039;t let them buy it?) would you want to play? <br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve had this experience. The games themselves were really fun! But, it got very tiresome aout the 10th kill with a weapon I couldn&#039;t get (I just simply wasnt gonna spend money on that game anyway) there&#039;s only <em>one</em> game I know did that and I still play to this day. Shell shock live has maps, colours, tanks (styles), and weapons that you can buy. I still play because:<br /><br /><br />1. I myself payed for those weapons a couple of months after I started playing it. <br />2. Even though there were different weapons that you can get only by buying them, all the weapons (and bros... they have about more than 50 weapons...) were nice and balanced. Even though you&#039;ll meet immature people who&#039;re jealous and spam you about how it&#039;s not fair. I brush them off knowing people spent time debugging and balancing everything <em>before</em> the game even came out. Which again brings me to the fact that CT can&#039;t do this alone, and we need a team if we&#039;re to go ANYwhere with this game?<br /><br /><br /><strong>==Original Post==</strong><br />oookkays thens... lol, lets get serious here... soo much tension on this thread, idk how to explain it! D: we&#039;re all a family right? i feel like we&#039;re all about to explode on this post but everybody&#039;s just keeping it coiled up, waiting to strike... anybody else feel like that? anyway, lets get back on topic.<br />director, it wouldnt make any sense to do that NOW. i mean 1. even if we do take them out, what would be the purpose of still keeping them? why give them out free when they&#039;re called &quot;premium&quot;?<br />2. i guess im fine with either way, BUT if we DO take them out i want my money back or SOMTHING because i still have leftover prem. creds.<br />uhm lamp.. im gald for your idea but, why make that site anyway? it jsut looks liek another forum! i mean, what would people ( new players like its made for i guess) do and talk about there anyway?<br />agreed natty, if you were i new player on a site where everybody has epic weapons that kill like terminator but you couldnt get it becuease you had to pay ( i would have no problem, but what if it was like now? how some people&#039;s parents wont let them, they dont have $, or simply the site has technical dificulties that wont let them buy it?) would you want to play? iv had this experience. the games themselve&#039;s were really fun! but it got very tiresome aout the 10th kill with a weapon i couldnt get ( i just simply wasnt gonna spend money on that game anyway) theres only ONE game i know did that and i still play to this day. shell shock live has maps, colours, tanks (styles), and weapons that you can buy. i still play becuease 1. i myself payyed for those weapons a couple of months after i started playing it. and 2. even though they were dif. weapons that you can get only by buying them, all the weapons (and bros... they have about more than 50 weapons...) were nice and balanced. even though ull meet imature people who&#039;s jelous and spam you about how its not fair. i brush them off knowing people spent time dubugging and balancing everything BEFORE the game even came out. wich again brings me to the fact that CT cant do this alone and we need a team if we&#039;re to go ANYwhere with this game?

Let me remind you something: OUR CARS HAVE HEALTH, REMEMBER? That was what he was referring to. The health bar would be 3/4s that of the car, or 25% more vulnerable to damage. If you are still confused, then think of it like this: the android has 1/2 of the health of a car.<br /><br /><br /><em>why does liftoff have to be so different? why cant we make it like the car, theres no difference between they&#039;re wheels</em><br /><br /><br />It&#039;s simple: the bike would be a more physics based vehicle. Things like instead of turning left you lean left, turning the wheels to the left instead of just turning the wheels left would create a more accurate bike riding experience. The same would be for the air: instead of the body of the car moving, the wheels would move pushing the body and possibly rotating and flipping it if you can&#039;t control it. For the record though, this was a good question.<br /><br /><br /><em>if it will have top speed AND accel, maybe even handling? why dont we make it that it cant fly? with all the other attributes it can launch up mountains 80 degrees steep or less going at least 50 mph</em><br /><br /><br />As said by answering you previous question, it would NOT have maximum handling. It would be a smaller and faster target but it wouldn&#039;t be say android level on avoiding gunfire; it still is propelled by wheels and wheels need to turn for a bit before it gets to top speed, plus the vise-versa of a complete stop taking longer. When flying it would move faster but still be an easy target for snipers and missile launchers, even more so that evasive maneuvers such as flips are much harder to pull off.<br /><br /><br /><em>maybe you can even move in air like a dirtbike! you can press WASD to rotate at flip. while pressing space you can also barrel roll</em><br /><br /><br />If you can give me one practical use for this I would fully agree, but it just wouldn&#039;t have a use. Plus the space bar scopes, remember?<br /><br /><br /><em>i dont see how thats possible, all the weapons have the same scope, and the cars can aim forward too.</em><br /><br /><br />I&#039;m going to take a shot in the dark and say you are referring to the turret being on the front of the bike. What that means is that you can aim forward DOWN as well as straight forward. The car would need to be lower than the target in order to shoot at them, at least forwards. The bike would not have this problem, though with 3/4s health it would less suited for sitting still and firing away due to return fire taking out the bike first. It would have to be limited to a run &amp; gun style.<br /><br /><br />Let me ask YOU a question: do you like the idea of the bike? I couldn&#039;t figure it out from your post.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>i dont have much time to reply all the way but for your last one, so how would you aim backwards? anyway, im not really sure, i like the idea and i was saying there was already a thread an everything for a vehicle just like it <br />( i think it was a hover-bike though?)
