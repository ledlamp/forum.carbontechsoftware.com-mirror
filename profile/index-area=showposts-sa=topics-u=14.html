I will check this forum before midnight EST once more at least.<br /><br /><br />Also, it&#039;s possible this is only temporary, or not even going to happen.

					I want you to look at how many people are online now, excluding bots. At best it hovers around 20 people, at worst 5. It doesn&#039;t take a genius to realize we don&#039;t appeal as much as other multiplayer games do. We don&#039;t have a big studio backing us or a energy system to do it. Some ideas I&#039;ve come up with are below, if anyone has any others please post.<br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Community outreach. This is the big one; we have said we are open to new members of the community but we haven&#039;t done a good job of showing it. Since it&#039;s the only major portal to host Unity3D I&#039;m mostly talking about Kongregate here, which we don&#039;t do a lot of good attracting the community. I can think of several reasons, including not keeping an update log off the forum, virtually no feedback on comments and a not very active developer account around the site (even before CT went AWOL). If people like our game they will stay with us and while content helps appearances matter too.</li><li>Controls. A newb has a horrible time controlling his car, as you have likely seen. The physics-based flying is fun but easily gets out of hand, driving has insane oversteer and weapons are hard to aim on the move. We can keep the controls but we need to make things like /flylock and hovering more noticeable, as well as add things like soft steering and aiming assist.</li><li>Staff. If we are to stand out from the pack we need to keep a friendly appearance, and staff (or more likely an active moderator crew) are critical. Now we can&#039;t dictate people&#039;s personal lives and I don&#039;t expect most moderators to come back but we can at least nominate a few more people. I was thinking of announcing that we are looking for moderators and seeing who comes knocking. It&#039;s pretty easy to tell who would make a decent moderator from a message, or at least who isn&#039;t.</li></ul>

					Now, this is simply a devastating gun with a painful consequence for using. Anything that&#039;s in the very large area of effect just dies, period, no matter what (even temporary invincibility, so as not the make it more preferable to the shield with this weapon implemented). There is also minor damage and lots of pushback for people just outside the area of effect. However, it has a one shot clip with a minute thirty seconds reload time and causes a few black dots to appear on the user&#039;s screen on detonation, potentially blinding or at least lowering visibility if the nuke is used repeatedly. There is also the fact it only moves as fast as the regular rocket launcher with no tracking, so it is possible for someone to miss and be locked in for a minute thirty with no weapon.<br /><br /><br />Thoughts? OP?

					All right, so here&#039;s the jist of it: Players try to enter a designated area defended by an invincible and super deadly car, at which point they join &quot;the club&quot; and become invincible and try to prevent other players from earning points.<br /><br /><br />More details: One player chosen at random starts out as a &quot;club member&quot;, who becomes invincible and gets a one-hit kill minigun. The rest of the players start out in normal gear. Players try to enter a certain area of the map known as the &quot;clubhouse&quot;, which is just an area really marked by transparent semi-sphere of light around and above the area. The club members get a point for each of their own kills, plus extra points at the end of the round for how many players are not club members. Normal players gain points by entering and staying in the clubhouse for 5 seconds, at which point they earn a bonus equal to the amount of players in the game minus the amount of club members and become a club member themselves. So the quicker you get to the clubhouse the more points you earn, and the better you defend the clubhouse the more points you earn. Friendly fire is locked ON, so normal players can kill each other if they feel that it would prevent them from getting to the hill. Rounds end after a set amount of time or when only one player is left out of the club. Club members also cannot leave the clubhouse, so they don&#039;t just go after kills and abandon their objective. You can bail out of your car and the same rules apply, with club members still being invincible and still killing in one shot. The winner is the player with the most points after 3 rounds.<br /><br /><br />Now, with a one-hit kill minigun the club members rain death to pretty much anyone they see. So the only way to reach the hill is by sneaking in, pulling off some awesome evasive maneuvers or going en mass with other players. It will only get harder to get in the club as the club gets bigger, so getting there first is key. At the same time, you will be battling other players to enter the club, so going lightweight with your equipment might not be the best strategy.<br /><br /><br />If a one-hit kill minigun is too powerful, then downgrading to a one-hit kill plasma blaster and if needed down to a quick-reload sniper or one-hit-kill missile launcher would solve the problem.<br /><br /><br />Possible clubhouse locations:<br /><br /><br />Battle Island: The bases, the abandoned bases, at the crashed spaceship sniper spawn area<br />Unity Island: The lake, the top of the highest mountain (the one with the invisibility powerup on it&#039;s peak)<br />Abandoned Silos: Between the two bunkers<br />Chokepoint: The bases, at the minigun spawns, the center platform<br />Sanctum: Center platform, platforms with two buildings, satalite dishes

					A gun that sacrifices overall performance for accuracy. Flak shells detonate when the fly close enough to a player to hit with the explosion radius (which would be small compared to other explosives, though not exactly tiny). It would have a slower fire rate faster than the shotgun but slower than the rocket launcher, and do mediocre damage (around 10-20) but it would travel rather fast and is able to hit cars at sniper distances with a good shot. However it would be outclassed the closer the target is by other weapons. This would limit it to whittling opponents down as they close or as an anti-sniper weapon designed to shake aim.<br /><br /><br />Due to distance, I would suggest giving the shell a contrail trail so players can locate who is firing at them.

					Well the title says everything. A rather exaggerated smoke grenade covering a wide area with smoke for getting past dangerous enemies without a fight to reach that flag/powerup. It would do minor damage with a direct hit on a car, and possibly frag damage. For the smoke, it would have to be around as big as the bases on Battle Island to be useful and it would have to fill up in less than 3 seconds and last at least 30 seconds.<br /><br /><br />Alternatively, they could be &quot;ninja&quot; smoke bombs that clog the windshield of those hit and blind the view of players with powder. There would be some visibility, but viewing distance is severely limited.<br /><br /><br />Both these would be in the form of grenades and so could be launched with more power by holding down the button.

					Hellooooooooooooo peoples!<br /><br />So what I want to share with you today is a (broken) model I made some time ago, which I no longer have the software to edit and fix. Anyone willing to take up the project in fixing this?<br /><br />It&#039;s a racetrack, the first (and last) model I ever made. It&#039;s got some cool jumps, obstacles, a spectator area and broken faces.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the wavefront file: <a href="http://www.filedropper.com/highwayrace" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.filedropper.com/highwayrace</a><br /><br />And no, I do not have a picture, since I lack the software to view the file.<br />

					I realize there isn&#039;t that many of us left, but I figured we are only going to lose members while CT hibernates so I figured I post this.<br /><br /><br />I want to try and bring back all the big ideas that were discussed over the period between the last update and now and put them together, sort them out and put them into one big document that we can have on hand just in case CT comes back. Every idea, no matter how popular (though it would likely be sorted based on popularity). That way a potentially great idea for the game is not lost due to this lull of absence of updates.<br /><br /><br />I think I could be able to create the final document, but I&#039;d need help digging out as many ideas as possible. So if anyone wants to help, just post some forgotten ideas you have found in the forums or just remember from back ago as well as as much info about them as possible (suggested by, positive or negative response&nbsp; how much talk was generated, anything you think is important).<br /><br /><br />It&#039;s a last-ditch effort to try and salvage some of the forum, at least for future versions we might not end up playing ourselves but to at least give Carbon Combat a potential future, and maybe some hope. Anyone knows of a previous idea that could have gotten implemented if there were just more frequent updates, please share it.<br /><br /><br />That is all.

					<span style="font-size: 1.35em;" class="bbc_size">Let me start this off with an announcement: I&#039;m back!</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">Yup, I now have access to a laptop that can run CC properly. Well, the keyboard is broken in an odd way (It types but the alphabet and number keys doesn&#039;t work in games so I have to custom map the controls to exclude the alphabet and number keys, which leaves me with my right hand on the arrow keys and using CTRL to fly, with a trackpad at my left hand and an on-screen keyboard at the bottom of the screen used for flipping my car and going on foot. Try it, it doesn&#039;t help) but it does run CC so I am able to play. If anyone needs training...go somewhere else, I&#039;m not good. I need training, someone please help me.<br /><br /></span><span style="font-size: 1.45em;" class="bbc_size">So anyways...<br /></span><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size"><br />As a new player in terms of equipment and car control I saw a different side of CC today. And it sucks bad. Let me go over the full list of problems: (note that below &quot;pro&quot; refers to players with a full set of fully upgraded equipment and average skill)<br /></span><ul class="bbc_list"><li><span style="font-size: 1.35em;" class="bbc_size">Completely incapable of competing with those who own armor &amp; weapons.</span><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">Any player</span><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size"> with the simplest understanding of the game could destroy any pro in newb gear when</span> they are decked out with fully upgrade weapons &amp; armor. Even if I manage to make a dent in a player&#039;s health, there is always a health powerup (which does so much more for their health bar than mine) or even worse, ninja regenerating armor. Of course this scenario never happens in survival mode, but no one plays it since non-CTF maps for some reason can&#039;t host it and bots never host survival games.</li><li><span style="font-size: 1.35em;" class="bbc_size">High equipment prices. </span><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">If I played an hour a day in standard 10 minute back-to-back rounds, I would be able to at best make the credit cap (already a rather optimistic estimate) of 700 for 6 matches</span>, for 4200 credits a day. It takes about 40000 to buy and fully upgrade a shotgun &amp; sniper rifle, 15000 for a vehicle, about 18500 to buy and fully upgrade ninja regenerating armor, and about 17000 to buy and fully upgrade a temporary shield, that&#039;s a total of 90500 credits to fully deck out your equipment to pro level. Now divide that by 4200 credits an hour, and it takes you a little over 21.5 hours to deck out your equipment, not including the fact that you don&#039;t always make the credit cap and that several pro players have back-up equipment in case their loadout isn&#039;t working. 21 and a half hours of slugging through the newb and mid-level ranks. We simply don&#039;t have enough content for anyone to spend that amount of time playing this game. Don&#039;t get me started on how long it would take you to buy out the shop.</li><li><span style="font-size: 1.35em;" class="bbc_size">Lack of balance with equipment. </span><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">I&#039;m pretty sure we could track when the last flamethrower kill was in years. There is also the factor of the shotgun which is hard to obtain for newbs </span>is a complete domination weapon which makes the rest of the weapons obsolete. There is also the factor of mines being completely useless and only being a cash trap for inexperienced of curious players, and the fact that armor offers no noticeable movement penalty making heavier and more exotic armors better than light armor in every way.</li><li><span style="font-size: 1.35em;" class="bbc_size">And of course, the n00b tactics.</span> <span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">Despite </span>our best attempts, there is still a good deal of ways to piss off a better opponent. The most obvious is /respawn to prevent them from gaining a kill and credits they deserve; it hurts their team, but a true n00b doesn&#039;t care about that. The shotgun has given way to the new way to spray &amp; pray over long distances, doing considerable damage. Matches between two decked-out players now comes down to jousting matches with the shotgun, eliminating most if not all pro tactics of before.</li></ul><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">I realize that these are problems we have accepted in the community, which makes it even worse. There is no movement to try and balance the game out, and if anything there is movement against just that with new and more powerful equipment coming out at higher prices (the shock armor to help snipers counteract the tactic of shaking their aim making them more dominant, the new vehicles which offer significant movement advantages over standard cars and most obvious the shotgun are some more recent examples). I have some ideas that could help the newb at least go 1.0 KD if they are skillful enough, but I know not all of them are popular (the last two ones). So let me start off with some simpler, more agreeable ideas:</span><ul class="bbc_list"><li><span style="font-size: 1.35em;" class="bbc_size">Equipment needs to be balanced. </span>What comes to mind as the standard OP weapon is the shotgun. The rest of the equipment is debatable and so I won&#039;t mention it, but come on, have you seen the amount of players using the shotgun? Ever wonder why?</li><li><span style="font-size: 1.35em;" class="bbc_size">Survival mode is available on all maps and is a possible game type bots play in.</span> Survival has become unpopular with pro players since they lose their equipment advantage, so they never host it themselves. It evens the battleground of a survival match a bit, but the fact is there are none. We need to give new players the option of playing survival mode instead of hosting a survival match and waiting around for half an hour before quitting.</li><li><span style="font-size: 1.35em;" class="bbc_size">Equipment needs to be cheaper. </span><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">I&#039;m not saying make it so you can buy out the shop in an hour, but </span>the rate at which you can buy equipment now is ridiculous. Item prices need to go down, especially for the more powerful weapons.</li><li><span style="font-size: 1.35em;" class="bbc_size">Upgrades need to go. </span><span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">Yes, let&#039;s get rid of upgrades, make everything start at level 20 when you buy it. It is such an obvious system of players with more money being more powerful than players with less money, even if they rent out equipment.</span></li></ul>Well, that&#039;s about it. I might add a poll later if something comes up in a debate, but I got what I wanted said out there.

					I wanted to make a poll, you see. But I needed a final result before a certain date, you see. But, when I put in a close poll date it did nothing, you see. The poll system is glitched, and I&#039;m surprised it works as well as it does. Some options do nothing, others make things worse (poll closes yesterday). Anyone else notice this when making polls or is it just me?

					Edit: Poll added. Also, this picture is at least 2 weeks ago. Apparently this happens more often than I thought.<em><br /><br />I&#039;ve been meaning to post this topic for so long now, so the picture is a bit dated. That shouldn&#039;t matter, though.</em><br /><br />So basically, I am sick of TinyChat. Normally I don&#039;t use it too much, but whenever I do it&#039;s always chaotic (see the attachment). The problems are pretty obvious:<br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>No log-in: Anyone can come and just start spamming/flamming with no way to identify and stop them. Plus impersonation has become a problem.</li><li>Bad moderation: The one (or occasionally none) moderator the chat assigns could be at the very best completely incompetent. At worst, it is a spammer/flammer who uses the privileges against normal users, and even forum moderators.</li><li>Front page: If this were a good chat then this wouldn&#039;t be a problem, but with the state it is right now it just degrades the forum face appeal. Imagine someone following the link to see if the forum is something interesting to follow, and they see the big white box on the bottom right.</li></ul>Basically, it needs to go. Replaced, hopefully, maybe with less features, but right now it&#039;s a mess.

					Now, I&#039;m going to say it: most of these suggestions are almost completely cosmetic. Why are they worth suggesting? Simply put, they give an appearance of something, most of which is &quot;that was cool&quot;. Let me start:<br />&nbsp;<ul class="bbc_list"><li><em>Screen shake</em>: Simple, anything that would shake the car (or would in real life) shakes the camera. It adds a bit of stun value and intensity to collisions and explosives. The camera shake would however never exceed a certain point so the player&#039;s screen is never obstructed.</li><li><em>Dive cone</em>: When moving downwards past a certain (high) speed a red cone of flames appears below it, like during space re-entry. Adds a bit of sci-fi and action to the game, and could simply be a slightly transparent cone with a red, possibly animated texture. Sorry I couldn&#039;t get a picture, surprisingly hard.</li><li><em>Drift</em>: Yes, drifting. An explanation for the near perfect turning, and could simply be the car tilting into the turn or a full gameplay feature with smokey tires and the works. Think I&#039;ll make that a poll.</li><li><em>Gun sounds</em>: Basically louder sounds for firing and delivering a weapon to a target. For instance, when firing a rocket a small click to signal the fuel being &quot;lit&quot;, a whoosh sound during flight and a satisfying <strong>BANG</strong> for the explosion. The perception of damage goes well with the perception of taking damage with screen shake too. Explosive canisters could get louder as well.</li></ul> Discuss.<br /><br />Edit: due to the drifting topic already been under/ is being under discussion, I removed the poll and encourage that if you wish to talk about the drifting idea it is limited to the link, or as part of a package involving more than one idea (or instance if you wish to rate each idea). I am also going to get a picture of the dive cone to add clarity in a few minutes.<br /><br />Edit: Here you go, first thing that popped up on Google. I might have to edit again to make sure I did this right, It&#039;s not coming up in preview.<br /><br />Edit, again: Apparently that didn&#039;t work, so let&#039;s try this:<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/A6jpU.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" border="0" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br /><br />There we go. The red flames are the &quot;dive cone&quot;.<br /><br />_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />So anyways, I would like to say that pretty much all of these ideas could come with a toggle on/off button for lower quality computers (with the exception of drifting, though if special effects such as smoke were added they could also be disabled by a button). So if you personally wouldn&#039;t use them due to a graphics card issue like I have but still want it then say so because it won&#039;t harm the game when they can be toggled.

					I think the title says for itself what I&#039;m proposing. An option for players (likely on the profile screen) to disable TinyChat on the home page, perhaps in favor of a larger most recent posts section. Me, I just want the load times for the chat GONE.<br /><br />Note this would be an option and those who want to chat can still chat.<br />
